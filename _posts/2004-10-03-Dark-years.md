The clouds are all dirty, as if they've boiled out of the back of god's sofa, dusty and forlorn. We can see through them now and then and the cirrus blow white and elegant in the gaps that close too soon. They are a species of pristine ice and unreachable beauty. Thin legs dangling into an empty pool and heads wreathed in our own grey smoke, autumn leaves rot beneath us.

Maybe our lives are like the skies. Everything out here has been tarnished and rusted. Only the flickering light of the old television shows us anything clean. Hollywood dentistry and French fashion, we dream of flying, and Angelina Jolie. We walk at night, knowing the stars are out there, somewhere: alien and cold.

Impossibly beyond us.
