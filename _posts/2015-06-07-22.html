<p>Twenty two steps is what it takes to come of age here, through sand that burns the soles to cinders, through ice that pulls the skin from bone.Â </p><!--more--><p>It is not a thing you do all at once, but one step at a time. The first footfalls are easy. It is allowed, if you are afraid, to make just one a year. To settle your heel and toes fully into a thing of scouring pain, with all your weight, and to take from it another year among your kin. It is that, or endless exile.<br/></p><p>Most take ten, or even fifteen, steps, as soon as they can. They rush the gates with ignorance and bravery, and come through the other side with both in shreds. Some rare few manage sixteen, but they become hobbling, prematurely broken: Children suddenly too old.</p><p>The last few steps are made to destroy. Our seers have had their own trials to draw on, whole lives of fear defeated, and know what innocence is. It is a thing that children have, and that adults must be torn from.<br/></p>
