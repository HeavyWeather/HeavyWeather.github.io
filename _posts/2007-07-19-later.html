<p>As promised, and in case you're wondering what I actually got up to last week, or why I missed you... here are the highlights from my trip around England. This is a long one, so be glad it's behind a cut. It does have a good start, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>In theory, not sleeping the night before a flight so that you sleep <i>on it</i>, thus avoiding jet lag, is a brilliant plan. I say 'in theory', because if you don't sleep on that flight (no matter how much red wine you drink), you're in a whole <i>world</i> o'trouble from the very beginning.</li>
<lj-cut text="read more"><li>Pork pies are proof that you don't know what you got until you don't got it no more. Now that I'm back in Canada I don't got it no more. This makes me quite, quite sad.</li>
<li>The people at <a href="http://www.excess-baggage.com/station_contacts.php#kings_cross">Excess Baggage</a> in Kings Cross station are -lovely-. Even when you taunt them with foreign climes.</li>
<li>It is a well known fact that hobos cannot read, and a good way of not getting kicked out of Regents Park while desperately trying to nap is therefore to prop a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Your-Dangerous-Idea-Unthinkable/dp/1416526854/ref=sr_1_6/202-8335548-0103855?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1181792679&amp;sr=1-6">pop-science</a> book across your face, thus cashing in on public misconception.</li>
<li>In such circumstances, ex-house mates <i>will</i> call you just as you're falling asleep as punishment. You <i>will</i> then think they're talking absolute rubbish until you've woken up properly and got moving again. You <i>will</i> be wrong.</li>
<li>Just... wrong.</li>
<li>At this point, visiting Camden is not a terrible plan, eating something is a fantastic plan (particularly if it's from a really good <a href="http://www.urbanpath.com/london/thai/busaba-eathai.htm">thai place</a> off of TCR), but visiting a pub is the gateway to absolute madness. If you are going to start drinking after no sleep in the last 50 something hours, you might as well head to Charlotte Street and do it in The Fitzroy Tavern, haunt of such literary greats as Dylan Thomas, George Orwell, and, um, Aleister Crowley, and a damned nice pub to boot. While you're at it, trying to hold a meaningful conversation with not one but two of your most academically gifted friends seems like a suitable challenge. From this point on, things may get hazy.</li>
<li>I do remember wandering around North East London for about an hour in the mistaken belief that points a and b on the map I'd memorised 'weren't that far apart', and being gripped by the fear that I may have stranded one of my best buddies in London for the night. Fortunately I was calmed by The Dave. Unfortunately, he then gave me access without companionship to a terrible, terrible idea.</li>
<li>When I lived in London I used to go to a big old Goth club called <a href="http://www.slimelight.net/Sportal/">Slimelight</a> almost every week. Slimelight <i>isn't</i> as good as it used to be, I don't care what you say. Although this statement probably does make me officially old, the experience did result in me discovering that if you have no intention of ever going back to a place, you can dance however the hell you want.</li>
<li>During my time in the Smoke I also spent countless hours on the streets at night. This turns out to be time well spent because it means that I can now happily navigate the night bus system with remarkable ease in any state. Any state at all. </li>
<li>However, four hours sleep is not enough to recover from the above. Not anywhere near enough. And trusting a load of goffs to look after you is, frankly, misguided. Winding up in <a href="http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/">Kensall Cemetary</a> and, more specifically, Kensall Cemetary Mausoleum, the next morning, probably didn't help my state of mind at all. Thanks, Ben. Thanks a lot. Even If I did get to meet a nice guy whose name thoroughly escapes me. </li>
<li>Obviously, the solution to being surrounded by centuries-old corpses, parasols and corsets, is to then surround yourself with morris dancers. This kind of thinking is pretty much typical of the rest of the day. More pie, more high quality cider (again, something not easy to come by in Canada), and a really nice hour or so in a Hammersmith <a href="http://www.fellwalk.co.uk/thame345fx.htm">pub</a> by the Thames beneath a beautiful blue sky with one of my all-time most mischievous partners in crime, follows.</li>
<li>Now, either I have done something very right in the cosmic scale of things, or by this point I'm being protected by the same divine force that looks after children, puppies, and drunken old men. Because I have clearly become completely unstoppable, and the rest of the day is spent in Shoreditch, at <a href="http://www.cargo-london.com/">Cargo</a> (once I've found it), drinking pear cider, eating nice (if slightly over-priced) food, listening to live postrock, with a grand finale provided by <a href="http://www.65daysofstatic.com/">65daysofstatic</a>, my most favourite band in the whole world. A band who announced this date mere hours after my arrival in London, and then saw fit to furnish one of the above gifted friends (Mr. Timothy) with the details via the intarweeb. Better still, I'm accompanied by him, another one of my best friends (the aforementioned Rocket), and a fantastic guy who introduces me to home-made t-shirts of awesome and playing tennis with penguins while getting progressively more drunk. I think his name began with a G but, honestly, I'm not sure. The 65' have also seen fit to find support that absolutely knocks my socks off in the form of <a href="http://www.yndihalda.com">Yndi Halda</a>.</li>
<li>Their 'Enjoy Eternal Bliss' album has not left my cd player since I got back. In case you're curious, there's a track of theirs <a href="http://www.icememory.net/cms/node/55">here</a></li>
<li>Anyhoo, cue the adventure back to... er, wherever Nina lives. Via, well, wherever it is that Tim lives. While clutching a battered drum stick in one hand. If I tell you that it's now midnight on Sunday you can probably work out how little sleep I've had from the above. And I may have had a pint or two to drink as well. Because both Tim and Nina are great, and the taxi driver picks up on the fact that I've managed to give him an address in one part of London, and a postcode in quite another, I do somehow wind up somewhere I can sleep.</li>
<li>For a miraculous <b>eight hours</b>.</li>
<li>Next morning, cue defensive London driving, ninja operations to the post office, a quick trip to the (leaking) Criminal Damage store in Camden, picking up my bags, and haxoring the Kings Cross pub wifi in a swordfish stylee as time quickly ticks away and my train pulls out of the station, leaving precious signal and London far behind.</li>
<li>Three days of trying to catch up on sleep at my folks place in the Fens, while hampered by a body clock that is now absolutely broken, ensue. I am partially consoled by huge amounts of food, walking out in the country, long and rambling chats with my folks (about family, food, cosmology, and 4 dimensional space) and the discovery that I can prove that hurricanes don't actually spin. I am, however, significantly miffed that I miss one or two of my friends who are in the neighbourhood at the time. </li>
<li>Fortunately, another one of my best mates (I've travelled a lot) actually detours past my mum's house on his way home so that I can see him and his girlfriend (whose name I -think- I remember, I'm awful), catch up on all the happenings from Nottingham and Spalding, and bemoan the fact that everyone I know is settling down, and buying houses, and getting engaged, or married, and having babies and.... you get the picture: Generally leaving me to wonder where the time has gone. </li>
</ul>
<p>And it is in this state that I wake up on Thursday morning, alledgedly ready to attend my graduation in Norwich. </p>
<p>But that, my friends, is a tale for another time.</p>
