Rather than neglect my duties, however, I thought I'd share the substances which have been responsible, as follows:<br /><br />Whisky and cherry coke <small>first consumed on bonfire night 2004</small><br /><br />1 bottle of cherry coke<br />1 bottle of Bell's whisky<br /><br />The perfect sneeky booze, take your undrunk bottle of cherry coke, open it, and fill it up with whisky, shake gently, and proceed to get laggered -and- slightly hyper while security pass you by. The joy of this is that the cherry coke is strong enough that you can actually keep on adding whisky to it all night long if you have a hip flask, so that once you're onto your second bottle it's actually very strong.<br /><br /><br />Purple Nasties <small>introduced to me sometime between 1998 and 2000 as part of the Slimelight crowd</small><br /><br />half of strongbow<br />half of carling<br />decent whallop of blackcurrant cordial<br />two shots of vodka<br /><br />Make a snakey and black, take a good sip, dump in vodka, stir gently. This is obscenely potent, ridiculously cheep in student bars (pricey elsewhere), and -will- do the job if you're in one of those 'just not getting pissed, somehow' frames of mind. Last weekend someone likened it to a normal drink that kicks you in the bollocks halfway down.<br /><br /><br />Peskies <small>invented, as far as i know, last thursday</small><br /><br />one shot of port<br />a good dash of jameson irish whisky<br /><br />Take shot, add dash, drink suprisingly nice substance that sets your ears on fire. <br /><br /><br />Please note that the management does not encourage excessive drinking -or- using decent whisky in any of the above.
