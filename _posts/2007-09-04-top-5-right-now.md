My top 5 right now are dominated by postrock and awe.

I must admit to being an -enormous- 65' fanatic, having seen them in tiny, tiny, venues all over the country. There is barely a day goes by without at least one of their songs making it into my ears, and hopefully after listening to this, you'll see why. The lads from Sheffield have a talent for kooky time signatures, monstrous tours, and absolutely epic albums that sound like nothing else out there. This track is the light at the end of the tunnel, it's clawing your way free of depression on nothing but determination, feeling every single thing that you've left behind every step of the way, and making it regardless. The 65 will be making it big with a tour across the states supporting The Cure next spring. Catch them if you can, because no matter how good they are on record, live they're unbelievable.

Caught supporting the 65' in London, this band also have a ridiculous amount of stage presence considering that they've only just started out. It's difficult to believe that their lead violinist hasn't signed some kind of faustian pact. Believe it or not the weird keening noise at the start of Dash and Blast is made on a guitar, and although it's a slow starter, this is one of the most euphoric pieces of music I've heard in a long, long time. Turn it up. All the way. I dare you.

<a href="http://www.clintmansell.com/">Clint Mansell</a> | <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/DEB4A49952A2268C">Death is the Road To Awe.</a>
Although he used to be a large part of the brain behind electropunk legends Pop Will Eat Itself, Clint Mansell has not really slowed down with age. Now he almost exclusively writes soundtracks, and this is a track from The Fountain, an absolute masterpiece of cinema with a score that is absolutely integral to the work. As good as this is, it only gains power if you've seen the film, which I also highly recommend. I should mention though that I adore cello, so I was going to be a sucker for this from day one.

<a href="http://www.royksopp.com/">Royksopp</a> | <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/vb4tfuijjp">What Else Is There</a> | <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOt15JsLloU">Video</a>
Featuring The Knife, this is a stand out track from Royksopp. It reminds you of whatever power you hold, even when you can't use it, and even if everything else is going to hell. After all, you are the storm, and you are the wonder.

and finally, because I wanted to throw a complete curveball into the mix:

<a href="http://www.genghistron.com/">Genghis Tron</a> | <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/1mfy5ygpak">Arms</a>
Not for the faint of heart. Trying to describe this band is nigh-futile, but imagine, just imagine, that someone had managed to come up with the perfect mix of chill-out electronica, death metal, drum and bass, breakcore, and stadium rock. Now, while you still think I'm a complete idiot, listen to Arms. Then listen again, just to make sure it's real.
