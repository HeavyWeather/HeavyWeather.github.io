<p>Gangly Men get everywhere...<br />
Curtain rails, cat's entrails,<br />
Even in balls of rotten old hair.<br />
Push in tight,<br />
No need for the light,<br />
Just sit and stare, <br />
With pale second sight.<br />
Wrapped up small, <br />
No shadow at all...<br />
Gangly Men unfurl in the walls.</p>
