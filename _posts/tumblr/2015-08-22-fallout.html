<p>My grandfather fought and died in The Long Ago War, and then he came back. He wasn&rsquo;t dead for long, but it must have been long enough.</p><p>All wars have secrets, but this is the secret of the Long Ago- it rages on. Not in today&rsquo;s streets, but in yester-year&rsquo;s. Our family seems to be the only ones alive who register the damage. Our friends vanish, and then never were. Whole city blocks change in front of us- bombed, ruined, redeveloped in the years between now and the war, but instant to us. Parts of our world are made unrecognizably new, with little fanfare and no ceremony. The questions ask themselves - what if it&rsquo;s our home this time? What if it&rsquo;s our mother? What if someone else wins the war?</p><p>This is how we live, never knowing why.</p>
