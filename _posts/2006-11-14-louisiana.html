Technically this is cheating under The Rules (as it's a firm favourite of mine and no real trouble to cook), but as we made them, so too may we violate them. Creoles don't really need any accompanyment, as they're -immensely- filling, and ridiculously warming, to the extent that if you eat them too quick they make your sternum ache. I think it has something to do with the heat retention of the rice. These things are supposed to be made with a selection of seafood, but two of our diners are less than keen on the bugs of the sea (I love them, personally), so this version is the inland version, mostly  done with chicken.<br /><br />Red Jambalaya <small>(there's a recipe <a href="http://www.realcajunrecipes.com/recipes/cajun/chicken-sausage-jambalaya/969.rcr" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but mine is a family thing)</small><br /><br />6 breasts Chicken<br />6 sausages (smoked or normal is fine)<br />100g of black pudding (shhh!, secret ingredient)<br />1 1/2 onions<br />4 cloves garlic<br />1 tin tomatoes<br />1 red pepper<br />1 green pepper<br />10 or so new potatoes<br />long grain rice (see below for quantity)<br /><br />Find yourself an old (and BIG) pan that will take some serious scrubbing, or better still, a cast iron wok or pot of similar volume. This recipe tends to stick to -everything-. First, brown off the chicken in cubes and set aside. Stick the sausages under the grill and leave them to cook while everything else is underway. Then brown the onions, garlic, pepper and potatoes, with cumin, pepper, black pepper, oregano, thymne, and a little chilli powder. Once they're done, add the black pudding, the chicken, and the sausages. Add just enough rice to thinly coat everything, and then add tomatoes and water until everything is covered. At this point, you could add a whole bunch of herbs and spices, but you might as well just buy Discovery brand creole sauce, because (honestly), it's just as good, add it, and mix well. The resulting goo will take about 30 minutes longer before the rice is cooked and most of the fluid is gone. if it's sticking too much, just add a little more water. <br /><br />And that should do the job.<br /><br /><a name='cutid1-end'></a>
