Up on the high hill are sentinel stones. They are wind worn pillars, twisted as if grown rather than carved. They are as tall as men, and women, and children. Each has a hole at their heads through which the wind passes at dusk and dawn. Landward and seabound breezes hush among them. The shorter ones, with smaller gaps, sing high tones on the edge of hearing. The more massive stones, towering above walkers and wayward sons alike, moan and sigh the passage of days. No-one remembers the people who put them there, but everyone knows what to call each column. This is the Monk, the Widow, that is Glass-stone, there, Babbling-brook. As the sun sets on Sleepness and gold splashes along streets and across rooftops, each of the Whisperers makes a quiet lullaby, and then falls silent.

Once upon a time the town had dreams of being bigger, but now it nestles into the hills and cliffs that bound it. It has become a place where people come to escape the world for the licking of wounds, the raising of quiet offspring. For the last days of living out long held memory before turning out the lights on their lives. The waves are gentled by the bay, the wind softened and sung by the high hill. Sleepness lives in a lull, remembering the dream of bigger days and darker nights.
