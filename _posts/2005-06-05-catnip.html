You're on fire tonight and everyone knows it, the smoke practically curls out between your eyelids, from underneath your fingernails.<br /><br />Gommorrah rolls along around you as if it were you that stood still and the city that were pressed to movement. Everything is easy. Everything comes with flow. Your machine will never break down, your arms will never tire. The canyoned horizon meets your eyes unblinking. <br /><br />'This is new.', Foster is turning the implant over in his hands with reverence. 'Seperates out the id and the superego, the animal in you gets on with things without interference and all that troublesome chatter. Ever wanted to move like a leopard, Jones?' He hands you the jar and for a second you catch your own reflection in the depths, your eyes already gleaming with feline hunger. 'Just don't get carried away, it might have some teething troubles. We've not really tested it yet'. Foster smells bad like rotting meat, but you pay all the same. <br /><br />When they find the body it's just legs kicking and twitching against concrete, thrashing out a tattoo on tarmac. The rest is obscured in brickwork and broken metal. The city has already started to clot the wound with your thickening blood and burning mortar.<br /><br />You're on fire tonight, and everyone knows it.
