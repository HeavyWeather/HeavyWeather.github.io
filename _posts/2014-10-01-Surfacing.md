he Mysterium surfaces like a whale from the deep, twisting, turning flank to flank. Staircases spiral tighter as they breach the earth. Buttresses appear like fins, like teeth. The whole edifice shucks dirt as it comes, sheds bricks from later ruins, and expands into the night. It shudders and shakes as more and more of it appears. A minute, three, five of roaring, arcing, masonry. Ana and Bea stand in shocked silence, fingers entwined hard enough to hurt. Finally it begins to settle its huge bulk into the ground. Muck rains down as it swells and contracts, breathing walls into place, flexing flagstones up through the last few feet between them and the air. Glass congeals in windows like ice, the gleam of metalwork blooms from inside its own corrosion. Steadily each flaw creaks or groans into submission.

And then it is perfect. Like it has always been. A grand circular hall, wings, and towers in shadow. Sweeping steps. Two huge oaken doors, swinging open on oiled hinges.

Bea shakes her head, tugs hard on Ana's hand, and flees.

But Ana cannot. She has a hole in her heart the same shape as the building that aches before her.
