<p>Time has stretched, light too. They warp, and contract, and stretch. The sun flickers but I can't be sure. Does it flicker? Has it? Will it? We can't speak to each other. Sound swoops in and out of our range, up through my bowels, howling up into my eyes. My skin writhes. We cannot adapt to this. I think it might be slowing down, but I don't know, it might just be time flexing. The waves roll by and break on sight, parts of our brains try to ride patterns. It's hopeless, too many variables are changing, too quickly... All of our tools are useless. I can see my limbs lengthen and contract, and I don't know... Is it my arms, is it my mind, is it light, or space... Fractals spall out from the blast, punching out width, flaying height. I can see them tear new dimensions in their wake and the mass curls inward. There is a smell like lightning, like curdled milk, pulling us in while the shock pushes out... I have become chaos, creator of worlds. The buildings arch upward overhead, and billow like aurora.

<p>I think I'm dying. How long it will take?
</p>
<p>Maybe forever. Maybe no time at all.
