<p>Certain artists have gone to amazing lengths to inspire oddity in their dreams, some have even consumed raw pork just before bed time. Cheese, however, is a sure path to night-time madness- scientifically proven to aid the sleep process, and inspire different types of dream based upon cheese type (you think I'm <a href="http://www.britishcheese.com/news.cfm?page_id=240" title="sweet dreams are made of cheese">joking</a>). Last night I ate almost entirely cheese for dinner, and the results were, well... unsurprising:</p>
<p>I am <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagliostro">Alessandro Cagliostro</a>. I am an actor, in a play, performing the role of Cagliostro. During this play, I select members of the audience to come on stage, and then place them in small open coffins, lined with silk. Some of my victims are nervous, and some of them are clearly very scared, but none of them try to resist in any way. I then cover these coffins with silk, and disappear from the play, to discretely appear in the front row of seats, watching out the rest of the show. It is about Cagliostro, and implies unspoken volumes about an unrecorded necromantic ability, but he is outside the spectacle. When the play is finished, and the hall is almost empty, a hall which suggests that this play is in a school or maybe college, someone from the audience comes up and sits behind me. They are quite convinced that I really am Cagliostro, and no matter what I say, I cannot outright deny the accusation. Everything that comes out of my mouth seems to insinuate that maybe I am him, and slowly I realise that my theatrical beard is not a prop. Slowly I realise that I actually am Alessandro Cagliostro.</p>
<p>The cheese responsible for this would be cheddar, reputedly responsible for dreams often containing content related to celebrities. I find it interesting that somewhere in my brain, a rather obscure 18th century occultist and scam artist is considered to be a celebrity. Still, I guess it's better than stilton inspired dreams about a vegetarian crocodile upset because it couldn't eat children, or about soldiers fighting each other with kittens instead of guns.</p>
