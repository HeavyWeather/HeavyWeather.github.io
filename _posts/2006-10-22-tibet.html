Or I'm just lazy.<br /><br />Tibet I discovered is a bit of a combination of Indian and Chinese cooking. <br />With more yak. I found most of my recipes on <a href="http://www.tibet.cn" rel="nofollow">www.tibet.cn</a> Yes, Tibet too <br />have their own internet. Their honourary national bread product is tsampa <br />and eaten with butter tea which sounds quite nasty. After reading a recipe <br />that emphasised the comedy of watching new tsampa makers look like their <br />fingers were covered in glue I decided to opt out.<br /><br />Yak is hard to find. To be honest I didn't really try but I'm guessing it <br />is. If you know different enlighten me. Although yak yoghurt is an <br />intriguing thought. yak lung less so.<br /><br />After musing over the various kinds of momos (steamed dumplings with various <br />fillings and shapes to choose from!) I chose vegetable sherpa momos. This <br />recipe makes about 12<br /><br />FILLING:<br />	onion, cabbage, green beans and cauliflower all finely chopped  and lightly <br />steamed or blanched until slightly limp, enough to make  about 3-4 cups.   * <br />5 cloves garlic (or to taste), diced<br />     1 large piece ginger to taste, diced<br />     1-2 tablespoons soy sauce<br />     salt, paper and accent to taste<br />     1 teaspoon garam masala* optional<br />     a little oil or ghee (clarified butter) to moisten<br />DOUGH:<br />     3-4 cups flour and enough cold water to make a smooth dough.  Knead <br />lightly and break off small pieces, rolling each into a thin  round about 3 <br />1/2 inches in diameter.<br /><br />DIRECTION<br />Put a heaped teaspoon of the filling in the middle of each dough  round. <br />Form the momo in any of the following traditional shapes,  using one hand to <br />pleat or pinch and the other to both hold the momo  and keep the filling <br />from oozing out:<br />o 8-pleated half moon shape;<br />o 6-pleated round shape, with the pleats in the center like a top- knot;<br />o the 9-pleated half moon shape with the ends brought around to  almost <br />touch; or<br />o the fluted half moon shape in which the ends have been brought  around and <br />pinched together to form a circle.<br /><br />Arrange on a steamer coated with vegetable oil spray and steam,  covered <br />l0-15 minutes.<br /><br />I made the dipping sauce suggested to be served with them. It was real easy <br />and although is stupidly dark on it's own was really tasty on rice and with <br />stuff!<br /><br />1 Tbsp soy sauce<br />1 Tbsp vinegar<br />1 Tbsp chile oil<br />1 piece of fresh ginger (about 1/2 inch long), shredded<br />Directions<br />Combine all ingredients<br /><br /><br />The main dish was kongpo shaptak (or kongpo style beef) To serve four...<br /><br /><br />Ingredients<br />1 pound top round beef<br />2 tablespoons oil<br />1 large red onion, chopped roughly<br />One half teaspoon paprika<br />2 cloves garlic, chopped<br />I (1-inch) piece ginger,<br />chopped one quarter teaspoon ground emmo (sichuan pepper, available  at <br />large grocery stores)<br />1 tomato, chopped roughly<br />One and one half tablespoons churu (blue cheese), crumbled<br />1 cup water<br />2 jalapeno chilies, sliced thinly on diagonal<br />Directios<br />Cut the beef into thin slices about one eighth inch thick and one and  one <br />half to 2 inches square.<br />Heat the pan over high heat and add the oil. Fry the onion until  brown with <br />the paprika, garlic, ginger and emmo. Add the beef and  stir-fry until <br />cooked through. Add the tomato and the cheese, and  cook until the cheese <br />melts. Add the water and stir in the chilies,  cooking for a few minutes <br />more. Serve with bread or rice.<br /><br />I just served it with boiled rice as my first foray into the world of <br />cooking from random countries was a bit daunting and I didn't wanna be over <br />ambitious!<br /><a name='cutid1-end'></a>
