<p>Despite what you may have read, there is no clap of thunder when it appears. It falls too slowly for that. It falls and it pushes the clouds from the sky, spiralling like a dying bird. It spreads wings and not a breath passes through them, slowing the creature to a halt before it even touches down. It settles gently upon tarmac and the ground gives beneath an enormous pressure. A thousand miles worth of height compressed; jagged cracks spidering away as it lands. They cower, Adam's children, hopelessly broken, or they bleed from the eyes, or scream. But their small voices reach it as the thinest of strains. They are flickering shadows, tiny, pale after-images of God. They burn away from the touch of its flesh, striding through them: a billion singing atoms to every one of theirs. Their mewling drowned out by the echo of its footsteps. It is too much for the world. A barely constrained nebula has come to earth. Reality a hundredfold- bone, concrete, steel, all fall in its wake, crushed by its aura. Cars are pushed aside; streetlights bent in two. It smiles and the very movement slays those nearest to it. It smiles, draws its sword, and speaks. Ten city blocks of downtown drowned in flame.</p>

<p>Gabriel looks up to where the satellites watch and vanishes, delivering the final part of its message. For the briefest of moments there is nothing but a blinding light which sucks flame inward. Cars scraping back across the broken pavement; streetlights bending the other way to snap. The ash of anyone caught in its wake, lost to eternity. Its smile, unforgiving like the sun, the last transmission of each broken mechanical angel.</p>
