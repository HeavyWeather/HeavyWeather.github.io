I've known Emily Comeau for almost ten years. Besides being an incredible friend, she is legitimately one of the most interesting artists I've ever met. She has a keen sense for cognitive dissonance, and knows exactly how to turn your own worst instincts against you. She makes toilet paper too precious to use, doughnuts you want to eat (but can't), beautiful canvases diligently reproduced in glue and glitter, and gallery pieces that beg you to shout and clap at them. You can see her work [here](https://emilycomeau.com/portfolio/) and now, you can also play a magnificent game she made with Nicolas Carrier: ["Smash The Patriarchy"](https://emilycomeau.com/smash-the-patriarchy/). <!--more-->

The aim of STP is to rise to the challenge of Situation cards with an Action, a Person, and a Thing, that when combined through cooperative play supply the necessary amount of Solidarity, Inspiration or Misandry. It is, fittingly, pretty difficult to beat, and deeply frustrating when killer combinations like:

A stone-cold feminist killjoy // telling gross man-babies exactly what they are // with boundless patience and grace. 

*or*

Katniss Everdeen // giving zero fucks whatsoever // with sage advice that comes from first hand experience. 

are *still* not enough to defeat the crappy Situation cards that are all too familiar every day occurences. This is part of the game's charm: That fantastical scenarios dug out of the fantasy life of Anita Sarkeesian (also featured) can (and do) still fail against energy-sappingly normalised events. Only when, eventually, Mary Shelley // organizes a politically charged flashmob // with a dick withering howl from the depths of Mother Earth, and you DO win a round does everything feel, for just a fleeting moment, actually hopeful and okay.
