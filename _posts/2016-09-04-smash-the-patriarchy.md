I've known Emily Comeau for almost ten years. Besides being an incredible friend, she is legitimately one of the most interesting artists I've ever met. She has a keen sense for cognitive dissonance, and knows exactly how to turn your own worst instincts against you. She makes toilet paper too precious to use, doughnuts you want to eat (but can't), beautiful canvases diligently reproduced in glue and glitter, and gallery pieces that beg you to shout and clap at them. You can see her work [here](https://emilycomeau.com/portfolio/) and now, you can also play a magnificent game she made with Nicolas Carrier: ["Smash The Patriarchy"](https://emilycomeau.com/smash-the-patriarchy/). 

Basically, Emily Comeau is kind of the worst, but in the best way. If you were going to punch Donald Trump in the dick, she'd hand you brass knuckles.
