<p>Electric cat's frame ripples with voltage. Coated with ultra-black fur it boils with nannites. Electric cat uncoils and leaps exactly like greased lightning, servos purring their pleasure. Multiband, telefocus eyes glint from neon: reflected back and forth forever. Everything it sees, I see.</p>

<p>Electric cat purrs, leaps, purrs, and microgyros whir along its spine. Four axis stabilised, in ninety nine out of a hundred tests electric cat lands on its feet running. Its tail switches to mewl out encrypted radio in frequencies only I can hear. Dogs oblivious to its dampened footfall or its telecommunication. </p>

<p>Electric cat is better than the real thing. Electric cat responds to my will only slighter slower than the speed of thought. It war-drives through the sleeping city. Through network after poorly protected network. Returning home each morning to download its prey at my doorstep, to flex and charge at my stroking touch. Summoned from the Orient, a demon... my familiar, housed in flesh that pounds with howling current.</p>
