I lost all my teeth last night, but it's okay, they're back now. They taste funny, and when I spit it's black. But I'm getting used to it. Sudden cavities and sudden fillings come and go overnight. <br /><br />When I was five I kept all my old teeth in a jar with a screw top lid. Dead wasps, bent pennies, bits of dirt, and all my old teeth: Aging in the sun. One day I heard about the tooth fairy from another kid, and that night I just left a scrawled 'fuck you' under my pillow in big red greasy crayon.<br /><br />We spend the rest of our lives paying for the stupid shit we do as children.
