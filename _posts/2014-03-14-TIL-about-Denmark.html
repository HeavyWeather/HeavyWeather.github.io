title: Things I've Learnt About Denmark
---

<p>Denmark is maybe the quietest country I have ever been to. In the heart of the city there is no shouting, no traffic noise, no baby squeal. If I laugh, and I laugh all the time, it fills up the whole street. It makes me feel huge, barbaric. It makes me wonder if this is how the stereotypical American might feel. If such a thing exists.</p><p>There is a lot of leather in this country and everyone wears black, but there don't seem to be any goths. Maybe everyone is a goth? </p><p>If you have a little English and German, written Danish is the easiest language to understand ever. I can get by just fine and I have never been here before. Spoken Danish, on the other hand, is completely impenetrable. Which might explain why everyone speaks English.</p><p>I speak two languages just fine, and can muddle through in another, but travelling around Europe is an exercise in feeling bad because everyone speaks my language and I don't speak theirs. It's a 'but I didn't get you anything' type experience, compounded by the fact that it would take several years to repay the favour.</p><p>Denmark is incredibly clean, and neat, and stylish. At its worst it looks like an impeccably tidy Germany. Danes have great shoes, and even better interior design. Particularly in Nørrebro.</p><p>Apparently Danes smell of perfume or cigarette smoke, but never both, or anything else.</p><p>Finding the only other branch of your favourite Icelandic cafe in Copenhagen is a great feeling, that when spoken aloud makes you sound like the biggest hipster in the world. Their breakfasts and juice are still amazing though.</p><p>Rural Denmark feels immediately familiar to me, because it looks a LOT like someone used MCedit to bond the Scottish Lowlands and the Fens, with liberal use of extra (awesome) bridges. </p><p>Eidellweiss snowfresh may be the nicest beer in the whole world. I'm not entirely sure that's what it's called though, because I drank quite a lot of it.</p><p>Danish sushi is incredible, as is Danish bread, but better still is the fact that they've recently started making a kind of miniature smørrebrød (open sandwich) in the same format, which is called... Wait for it... 'Smushi'.</p><p>Although there are lots of awesome statues everywhere (dragons? Goat skulls? Giants with horns that are supposed to blast if virgins walk by? A bull wrestling a giant fish? Hell yeah!) Apparently the little mermaid statue is much less impressive than people hope for, because it's life sized. </p><p>There are magpies absolutely everywhere.</p><p>For a reason that completely eludes me, Danes love to put their power plugs above your head. Even on trains.</p>
