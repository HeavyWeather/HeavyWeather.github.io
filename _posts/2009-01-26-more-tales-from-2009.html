<p>Things I have found out, so far:
</p>
<p><b>Icehockey is awesome</b>
</p>
<p>I am less awesome <i>at</i> icehockey. Playing on an outdoor rink is surprisingly not lethal, to the extent where you can happily strip down to thermals, jeans, and t-shirt once you've got going, even when it's who knows how much below (-15, maybe?). Playing in the most offensively OTT union jack t-shirt London has to offer will not get you killed, even when playing against random quebecois youff. Falling on your ass only twice over the course of 3 hours is totally respectable. And only a little bit painful. The next day.
</p>
<p>I really get the feeling that the longer I do this, the more fun it'll be. I do have to learn how to handle a stick better, and I also need to learn the crazy icehockey stops (that'd get you killed on rollerblades) but fortunately I have two gifted amateurs showing me the ropes. I'm really hoping this becomes a semi-regular thing, not least because it got me out of the office early on a friday afternoon!
</p>
<p><b>Santropol's 'Northern Lights' is delicious</b>
</p>
<p>In a potentially ill-advised experiment I'm vaguely trying to cut down on the amount of meat I consume. This isn't some kind of crazy new years resolution thing, but is instead inspired by a man named Kevin. Kevin is the first person I have ever met (up in Yorkshire) who manages veganism <i>and</i> a highly strung metabolism. As far as I'm concerned veganism can get knotted (Cheese? Yoghurt? Chocolate? Verboten? Like hell!) but trying my hand at a non-dogmatic semi-vegetarianism seems like an interesting thing to mess around with for a month or six. Particularly given the tasty vegetarian foodstuffs being hurled around while I was visiting Rhi, and vegan stuffs hurled around by me over new years for my mate Jo. In the first week I've cut down dramatically, but the amount of chocolate and bread products I eat has shot up. This seems consistent with the fact that most vegans I know eat a LOT of crap. Also, I'm currently utterly addicted to Baba Ghanoush.
</p>
<p>I'm really not expecting this to stick permanently but I definitely do want to expand the number of interesting recipes I can cook for my more prescriptive friends. If you are that way inclined and know of anywhere particularly good resource wise on the interweebs, or just have an absolutely favourite thing, please do let me know.
</p>
<p><b>The Game is afoot</b>
</p>
<p>After a month and a half of playing on UK pool tables, I'm back to full on sharking this side of the Atlantic. Tables are smaller, balls are bigger, pockets are the size of your head. Friday night at the Cock and Bull pub is an exercise in playing better and better opponents until the tiny jazzfiend frenchman comes out of his corner to 7ball you. Very satisfying.
</p>
<p>RP wise, Star Wars is a much better game when you ignore film conventions. I've been pushed into shrinking my time line down to a month because one of the players is vanishing and I'm getting sick of dangling plot. This means that I kind of -have- to run it more as the kind of game I want to - already we've had a little gore, a lot of force based insanity, and hordes of Jawas with vibroknives. Hootini! I swear, by the time I'm done with them that wailing cry will become an omen of sheer terror.
</p>
<p>Lastly, I begin my foray into the madness that is RP on WoW this week, because the company is too good to turn down. I've always played PVP because I thrive under that constant state of junglewarfare paranoia, and muhmorpergur arpee'ers can be a weird group even by the standards of weird, but I can only imagine that the bunch I'm hooking up with will redefine the term 'laughriot', especially Mitz. To that end, Lugosi is going on holiday to Argent Dawn. All you hordies over there, drop me a line, yo. If you should catch me in undercity, gazing out over the foetid waters wistfully, please just gank me where I stand.
</p>
<p>Oh, and p.s., I finally have an ebay account and am thus likely to become very poor, very soon. XD
