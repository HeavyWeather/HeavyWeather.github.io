title: Resistance
---

Our pale horses are breakers upon the waves of grass that sweep across this open land. Pennants snap above us like handclaps to our hunting song and the clouds skid through the sky. These days are ours. After years of war, these lands are Xiao lands. All trace of resistance has melted away before the rumble of hooves.<br /><br />We stop at a small Shan province camp for the night, exhausted but triumphant. The locals and their daughters are pliant. They bring us food, and pleasure, and we refrain from slaughter. Even when the wise woman comes late in the evening to tell us we will all die by the whim of water, we refrain. Our Captain cuts out her tongue and removes her hands at the forearm. As we leave with the setting moon the seer's twin spits at us and fades away like a vengeful ghost made whole.<br /><br />The further we ride into Shan the more the local aquiescence feels like pity. There is no rebellion, but the night is quietly hostile and the same faces appear again and again... all the locals look the same, it is an easy mistake. Regardless, unease blossoms within us. In Karolei we are greeted by a muttering old man who sits on his porch, blowing smoke rings from a pipe. There is a trick to it such that the rings twist into animal shapes.<br /><br />When we reach Ragolan the farmers are singing horribly out of time in their fields. When pressed the stoney faced barkeep tells us it is a weather-charm such that they may prosper. we laugh at him, laugh at the farmers and their ugly plea. We laugh at the whole of hopeless little Shan and ride on.<br /><br />The next day, heads held high and horses gleaming, we come across a travelling artisan in the fields between Bashomet and Vethia. We are still smiling at Ragolan bad fortune. The sky has turned grey and come down to meet the ground. Everything is swaddled in mist and there is a distant thunder to match our own. We can smell the coming rain. She will not move for our horses and we laugh. She is tall, but she is unarmed, and she travels alone.<br /><br />'You are not even sport!' Our Captain cries, 'yield to us!' But she will not move. She stands, feet shoulders width apart, all Shan tranquility. And she will not move. We note her whispering beneath her breath. 'What do you say?' The Captain shouts, 'Do you mock us?' Even when our Captain sighs, and gestures at an archer to shoot her down, she fails to react.<br /><br />Only when the bolt is in midair, does she move.<br /><br />A subtle gesture, a flex of fingers, and the arrow's path shifts. Instead of flying straight and true it arcs toward the earth as if slowed, outweighed. Aghast, the archer knocks another, but he is too stunned to draw it. Something in the air is moving. The woman before us curls her fingers to it, bends her arms, and coaxes it to life. Within her grasp the mist is become fog, the fog something more solid still. Boiling out of nothing it spirals at her touch to form a spar. Before our man can recover his senses she holds her spear of cloud, hefts it, and throws it hard and fast. He is lifeless long before he hits the ground. And already another spins to her hand.<br /><br />Every blow we begin is deadened as if made underwater.<br /><br />Every time she strikes, another man falls blasted and breathless.<br /><br />Lying here, drowning on icy drizzle at her behest, I think of hopeless little Shan, of a patience that looks like pity, and I try to laugh.
