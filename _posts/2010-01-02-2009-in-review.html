Now that we're clear of it, <br /><br />1. What did you do in 2009 that you'd never done before?<br />Crikey, a bunch of things. The big one has to be learn to play cello, and then perform at a recital. That's been an adventure and a half. Um, I also crossed a national border by train, went to DC, licked the Washington monument, and visited the Smithsonian, that was another one. Camping in Canada. Seattle to have my dreads tightened up and to meet the lovely lishd and gorthok, and a tonne of hippies at some kind of strange festival thing. Generally maintained a set of dreads (which has been hugely satisfying). I've had published material in print that I was subsequently payed for, saw my first live hockey game, seen a bunch of new live bands (including Party In Hiroshima, finally), held an eagle owl, aaaand lived in four houses in one year.<br /> <br />2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?<br />I resolved that if I had two choices at any one time, I would chose the more awesome one, limited only by immediate funds, regardless of how tired, or annoyed, or busy I was. Which... seems to have worked, most of the time? This year it's keeping that one and learning to drive. There are other things that I'd like to do, but they're not resolution worthy- learn more french, get published more, blah blah blah.<br /><br />3. Did anyone close to you give birth?<br />Practically everyone. It's like an epidemic. I'm worried that this year I'm going to find myself pregnant.<br /><br />4. Did anyone close to you die?<br />No, thankfully.<br /><br />5. What countries did you visit?<br />Just the States. I live in Canada and the UK is my home, so I can't really visit either of them.<br /><br />6. What would you like to have in 2010 that you lacked in 2009?<br />A cello of my very own. As far as material things go, I think that's pretty much it.<br /><br />7. What date from 2009 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?<br />I'm awful with dates, next question!<br /><br />8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?<br />I think it has to be the quartet piece we played at the recital, considering that I'd only been playing for 6 months. It certainly felt like the biggest thing at the time! After that, my bastardisation of the recipe for chocogeddon brownies- a proper "I can see through time" moment.<br /><br />9. What was your biggest failure?<br />My biggest one was not getting home for the wedding of jmons and kaz. There was some stuff with my dad that was crappy too.<br /><br />10. Did you suffer illness or injury?<br />I suffer from pretty much constant injury due to being too awesome for the world. Having said that. I was continuously ill with some kind of low level cold throughout September, which sucked and was not at all awesome.<br /><br />11. What was the best thing you bought?<br />My travel chest, it's aces.<br /><br />12. Whose behavior merited celebration?<br />Many many peoples. My mother's particularly, but a whole gang of folks all over the show. And by "show" I mean Europe and North America.<br /><br />13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?<br />News Media throughout December. The legal profession through May.<br /><br />14. Where did most of your money go?<br />Cello. More expensive than a substantial drug habit. Fortunately, worth every penny.<br /><br />15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?<br />Seattle was pretty damn exciting.<br /><br />16. What song will always remind you of 2009?<br />This Weather by Patrick Wolf.<br /><br />17. Compared to this time last year, are you<br /><br />i. happier or sadder?:<br />With the proviso that this time last year I was in the UK, generally Happier. A lot of stuff in my life was rubbish then, and almost all of it is not rubbish now.<br /><br />ii. thinner or fatter?<br />Slightly thinner. Somehow (through no fault of my own) I've actually lost weight over chrumbletroid.<br /><br />iii. richer or poorer?<br />Richer, thank goodness.<br /><br />18. What do you wish you'd done more of?<br />Francais, visit√© Lachine.<br /><br />19. What do you wish you'd done less of?<br />By default, Anglais. <br /><br />20. How did you spend New Year's?<br />I had a frickin' epic New Year's over at le Theatre Plaza. Best party I've been to in aaaaaages.<br /><br />22. Did you fall in love in 2009?<br />Does cello count?<br /><br />24. What was your favorite TV program?<br />Either Skins or Flash Forward.<br /><br />25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?<br />Goodness, no. Which is nice seeing as I've met a whole bunch of new folks.<br /><br />26. What was the best book you read?<br />Last year was been amazing for books. Jonothan Strange, Midnight's Children and Fun Home have all left a substantial mark. Being really good friends with an english lit. teacher is -fantastic-.<br /><br />27. What was your greatest musical discovery?<br />The montreal Dubstep scene and, weirdly, The Swell Season. Not because they're amazing (although they are), but because I went to their show entirely on a whim and it utterly bowled me over.<br /><br />28. What did you want and get?<br />Victory.<br /><br />29. What did you want and not get?<br />Cake. All too frequently.<br /><br />30. What was your favorite film of this year?<br />I adored Avatar. Moon was great as well.<br /><br />31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?<br />I was positively ancient, but I had a week of festivities that were all fantastic. Meals out, a picnic, the circus, and a trip to the States.<br /><br />32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?<br />Teleportation between Montreal and England.<br /><br />33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2009?<br />Snood.<br /><br />34. What kept you sane?<br />Distraction<br /><br />35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?<br />Tilda Swinton. No change there then.<br /><br />36. What political issue stirred you the most?<br />Climate change has been inescapable for me this year. Normally I try to keep the political side of it as far away as humanly possible.<br /><br />37. Who did you miss?<br />Too many people to list. Until I moved away I never really "missed" anyone, mostly because I was all over the place all the time. Now that there's an ocean in the way I'm finally seeing what all the fuss is about. <br /><br />38. Who was the best new person you met?<br />Again way too many people. My D&D group are the frickin' bomb though. And I'm annoyed that a whole bunch of folks live on the western coast instead of the eastern one. Oceans. Bastards.<br /><br />40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:<br />Gah, impossible, I'll be here all day.<br /><br />My opinion on the year 2009:<br />Shady start, slowly turning around through may and june, epic finish.
