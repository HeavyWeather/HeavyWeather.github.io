title: The Trick
---

<p><span>Johnny shows Jane the trick.<br/>Standing in front of her, sleeves rolled up.<br/>He takes the corks from the wine they&rsquo;ve been drinking, and idly passes one through the other. Hands flowing like water. <br/>She stops. She stares. She asks him how it&rsquo;s done.<br/>Johnny shrugs, and gives her a mischievous smile.<br/>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a trick&rsquo;, he says<br/>Later, on the way home, he admits to himself that he doesn&rsquo;t know.<br/>That he&rsquo;s tried to remember how it&rsquo;s done, where he learnt the knack of it. <br/>But that nothing comes. <br/><br/>Two weeks on Jane shows Johnny the corks.<br/>Awkward, a twist, a sleight of the hand.<br/>Step by stiled step, eyes narrowed with focus, she shows him the knack of it.<br/>He smiles. He nods.<br/>'That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;, he says.<br/>But later, when Jane has gone home, he admits to himself that it isn&rsquo;t. <br/>Johnny takes the hands he&rsquo;s been staring at and with a shrug, with a troubled smile, idly passes one through the other.<br/>As if they were water.<br/>Trying to remember where he learnt the trick.</span></p>
