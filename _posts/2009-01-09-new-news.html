<p>Right then. Livejournal. Nowhere near as dead as drama would have it, apparently, and neither am I! Folks keep on poking me to post some actual stuff rather than appearing in comments at random like some super snide spectre (try saying that five times fast!), so here I am. 2008 was a well funny year, with both glittery lights and gloomy bits in abundance. I don’t think I could summarise it even if I tried, and one of those meme things would just leave me (and everyone else) totally confused. So, let’s pick up with the relevant bits of 2009 and just go on from there, eh?
</p>
<p><b>I have been much more exposed to owls in 2009 than 2008. </b>
</p>
<p>I like owls, but it turns out that my step sister, in addition to growing into a razor sharp wit, now works in an owl sanctuary. Bengali Eagle Owls are enormous, beautiful, surprisingly heavy, very strokable, and lovely when trained. They will not eat your fingers even when you think they might. Although I love the one I have, I’ve always secretly wanted a bigger family, and it’s happened without me really noticing it, and it’s great. Particularly because it includes owls.
</p>
<p><b>I have fallen in love with London again. </b>
</p>
<p>I realize now that I will never really stop missing it. Yes, it seems insanely crowded compared to almost every other city I’ve ever been to, and Yes it only takes 24 hours for your mucus to turn black BUT it’s wonderful. It’s even more wonderful when you’re not so poor you have to eat the same thing for four days straight. And when Camden market has suddenly become 30% more like the old Kensington market which was the best market in the world (other than being a huge fire risk). AND when you haven’t slept properly for quite some time and your friends are all doing very exciting things like playing gigs at classic London venues, or getting married, or having children, or are ginger. The only problem is that now I realize I also love and miss Montreal and I can’t possibly be in both places at once.
</p>
<p><b>Having dreadlocks is exciting.</b>
</p>
<p>Normal hair does pretty much what you tell it to, and you can mostly forget about it, even when it’s ridiculously long. Sometimes you even actually forget you have really long hair. This is not possible with locks. Firstly, I have to wear them down or in hats much more because I want them to grow fat and strong, but as I’ve been idly tying the stuff back for years now, that’s quite nice. Secondly, they’re really organic in the way they grow and change (anyone remember the ubergoo?), so I find them fascinating to watch and play with. Thirdly, I’m an enormous ENORMOUS nerd for being really into the fact that I have 31 of them. Extra geekpoints for you if you know why this number is interesting (unless I’ve  already mentioned it). Fourthly, they make me feel a little bit like a lion. I’m a month in this weekend, I’ve already sat down to several important meetings without anyone noticing, and I don’t regret it at all.
</p>
<p>I’m working in Norwich at the moment, so obviously I’m very busy with work (*cough* yes, obviously *cough*) and (more realistically) going mental. To that end, I’m off out but there’ll be more coming soon LJ-land, and you can poke me with sticks again if it doesn’t!
</p>
<p>Oh, and p.s. “Dog Days Are Over” by Florence and The Machine is the best BEST track of 2009 and is utterly kicking my arse all over the show. Go listen to it, it’s awesome I tells ya.</p>
