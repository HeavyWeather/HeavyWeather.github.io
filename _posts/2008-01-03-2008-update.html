<p>Three days in, and so far things are oooookay. I've not made any resolutions at all, but I have kind of made a vow to change the things I'm not happy with. These 'things' are nebulous, hard to get hold of, and impossible to explain, so I'm not going to. So far in 2008 I have:</p>
<p>+ danced like a twat to crystal castles.<br />
+ made the most intense chocolate mousse ever.<br />
+ played in the snow.<br />
+ had a day of doing absolutely fuck all.<br />
+ decided for definite to take two months off from french classes before going back in the spring<br />
+ sketched, a lot.<br />
+ said 'yes' to trying out yoga.</br>
<lj-cut text="read more">+ listened to an awful lot of reggae.<br />
+ started to wrangle my sleep pattern into something like reasonable (ish).<br />
+ ditched the beard.<br />
+ cut off about three feet of hair.<br />
+ generally sorted out my face.<br />
+ played in the snow a bit more.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is going to museums (which I thought I was doing today, but hair amputation occured instead), uploading all my photos and video from the holidays, more sketching, researching some stuff for fiction, and probably making yummy sandwiches.</p>
