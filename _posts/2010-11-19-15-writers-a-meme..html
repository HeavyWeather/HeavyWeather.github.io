title: 15 writers - a meme.
---

I'm fairly heavily under the influence of a bunch of medication right now. As a result of that I have done NOTHING productive all week. I've produced maybe one kind of funny sketch, I've realigned the chakras or whatever of my bit of the house (by which I mean I've moved everything, and half of that to the bin), and I've written this thing. It's been a challenge, but I've needed to write something, just to have it on the go and not feel utterly useless. <br /><br /><i>Fifteen authors (novelists, poets, playwrights, etc) who've influenced you and that will always stick with you.  List the first fifteen you can recall in no more than fifteen minutes. </i><br /><br />I fundamentally disagree with the fast and disposable nature of these memes, however, and I'm going to cheat as heavily here as I did with the video games. You can’t stop me. It’s already too late. I’m not even including Tolkein or Shakespeare here, because if you’re anything like me they’re the literary equivalent of hydrogen or oxygen. They get into absolutely everything and then react with it and thus... the cheating begins.<br /><br /><b>Roald Dahl</b> (Gerald Durrell)<br /><br />Yes, for his children’s stories, but more so for his unexpected Tales. I think you could probably chart my switch from childhood to adolescence fairly accurately by the Dahl I was reading at the time. I might possibly have read everything he wrote prior to 1991, and after that, Dahl was slowly replaced by Durrell. I’d spent some time in the Balearics already by then, so Dahl’s stories of flying became a very real bridge to an island populated by my family, and other animals. <br /><br /><b>Neil Gaiman</b> (The Greeks, Folklore)<br /><br />I started my full-on war against book at about the age off eleven, at exactly the same time I gained access to the local library. When the inevitable betrayal of C.S. Lewis hit me, I had stacks and stacks of literature to retreat to, and from which to plan my revenge. After a childhood full of Aesop’s fables, Bre’r Fox, and Anansi, Greek myth became both my frontier and my weaponry. Myth was atomic narrative, the most basic unit, and I ate all of it.  When Steve “The Horn” Hill handed me Gaiman’s Sandman, it was like nukes. It would be years, after all the Sandman, its spin-offs, even Charles De Lint, until I would finally deliver the killing blow against C.S. Lewis, courtesy of Phillip Pullman and a subtle knife.<br /><br /><b>Tom Holt</b> (Terry Pratchett, Piers Anthony)<br /><br />Had it not been for Holt, I might never have read Pratchett, and if you’ve read Pratchett, you should read Holt. The fact I laugh at pretty much everything is partly because the moment I got something Very Serious to dig my teeth into, literature wise, Tom Holt pissed all over it from a very great height while cackling maniacally. He basically wrote about eleven books of Good Omens before Good Omens even existed. Had it not been for Piers Anthony’s Xanth series paving the way, it might honestly have been too much of a departure for my little brain to handle.<br /><br /><b>Michael Moorcock</b> (Roger Zelazny, Robert E. Howard)<br /><br />I’ve mentioned the fantasy epic of Narnia already, but it doesn’t get a spot here because it was like an entrance exam. It was important, but I begrudge it, and it went by in a blur, and it’s the stuff that came afterwards that was really, actually, important. I think I started with Howard’s Conan at around thirteen (an easy transition from the Babylonian stuff I’d been devouring*), and then it was The Chronicles of Amber, and then Moorcock’s mirrored earths. Although Amber’s Pattern vs. Logrus would come back to haunt me later, it’s the Moorcock I’m leading with here, not because I feel any sympathy or identification with Elric, but because at the time I didn’t know you could even do that with a story, and because the emotional tone of the Melnibone sequence is something I still carry around with me. <br /><br /><b>Arthur Conan Doyle</b> (Ian Fleming)<br /><br />I read Sherlock and Bond almost at the same time, and they were practically another pair of Eternal Champions. Sherlock gets top billing of the two because he squeaked in first, and echoed back to the tricksters of my childhood with a fresh and complex constellation of exploits. Sherlock got me into Bond, and Bond (in a weird and roundabout way) into The Invisibles…<br /><br /><b>Alan Moore</b> (Grant Morrison, W.B. Yeats, William Blake, John Milton)<br /><br />I had a lot of trouble here, choosing between the British occult authors I consumed post-Sandman. Moore gets it because he’s EXTRA Meta: Promethea, A Disease Of Language, Voice Of The Fire. Morrison shaped me growing up (particularly for The Invisibles), but Moore applied the polish. Yeats, Blake, and Milton fade into the background a little because I can honestly never remember which one of them wrote which piece. I’m sure literary scholars can tell easily, nodding, stroking their beards, but with a few notable exceptions I forget, and it all becomes one mad Scotsman**, in a tower, trying to raise the devil. Which is why they’re filed under Morrison. The irreverence mentioned above (under Holt) comes back around here, because I’m going to tip my hat to Peter J. Carroll in a fit of anglocentric underground weirdness, and move on.<br /><br /><b>William Gibson</b> (Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson)<br /><br />At a relatively early age I realised that witchcraft was no career for an ambitious youth, and that I’d need to come up with a better plan. Physics seemed like the next best thing, and Gibson happily supplied the bridge (badum-dum-tish) between high science and voodoo. Bruce Sterling would have had this spot due to Heavy Weather if his endings weren’t UNIVERSALLY DIRE. Neal Stephenson might have had it if he hadn’t given up as an author after Snowcrash, Diamond Age, and Zodiac, to assume the role of The Great Deforester and Choker Of Horses. Instead it’s Gibson. Because I love pretty much everything he’s ever written, I envy his lifestyle, and he revels in the space between technology and culture.<br /><br /><b>Philip K. Dick</b> (Susanna Kaysen, Kay Redfield Jamison, Elizabeth Wurtzel)<br /><br />When it comes to actual sci-fi, though, I’m not in it for Asimov, or Blish, or Pohl. I’m in it for… well, for Mr. Philip K. Dick. He wrote from a place that was so disjointed from the world he lived in that any given future must not have seemed very far away. Some of his stories are so widely appealing that they are foundation stones of modern Western culture (Do Androids Dream) while others are so disturbing that I don’t really recommend reading them to anyone (A Scanner Darkly). Even if they do feature a drug named Substance D. Fittingly, Philip K. Dick (along with Stephen R. Donaldson) marked the transition for me from allegories of mind and disorder to books that tackled the subject head on. I went through a pretty tricky patch in my early twenties around this time (possibly spurred on by an immense bout of pneumonia), and came out the other side of a body on fire with very different priorities. <br /><br /><b>Gwyneth Jones</b> (Italo Calvino, Samuel R. Delaney, Jeff Noon)<br /><br />Because Kairos is Samuel Delaney’s Dhalgren, rolled into Jeff Noon’s Vurt, and better than both. I can’t say how Kairos influenced me, exactly, but I know that it did. While I was very much involved in rotating out most of the stage props on my life, Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities painted all the new backdrops, but Kairos was the WD40 and duct tape that made the change (relatively) seamless and smooth.<br /><br /><b>R.S. Borgstrom</b> (Jenna K. Moran)<br /><br />Rebecca Borgstrom doesn’t exist. Nonetheless, she’s had a huge influence on the way that I write, when I write, when she writes. While we’re on the subject of people that don’t exist, though, I also very much enjoyed all of JT LeRoy’s books.<br /><br /><b>Terry Moore</b> (Alison Bechdel)<br /><br />I had the great pleasure of meeting Terry Moore earlier this year*** only to then talk ever so briefly about Strangers in Paradise, a three volume comic book that genuinely helped me get through some pretty crappy times while also being vastly entertaining. It is one of only three publications I’ve bought this year. If you like comic books, you should read it. If you don’t like comic books, you should read it. If you have any idea what the Bechdel test is, you should definitely definitely read it. And then Fun Home, because gosh is that ever a beautiful, beautiful thing. <br /><br /><b>Virginia Woolf</b><br /><br />By now I’ve read a very small number of Woolf’s books enough times that, by volume (ho ho), I’ve read as much as if I’d have read everything she’s ever put down in ink, from beginning to end, birth to death. Having said that, I am slowly making my way through the rest of her material. I’m not in a rush. It’s a pleasure. I’m pretty sure I can read faster than she can write thesedays, anyway.<br /><br /><b>Douglas Coupland</b> (Chuck Palahniuk)<br /><br />Goodness, what to say about Douglas Coupland? Canadian. Hypermodern. Lonely. So very, very, lonely. An observer of minutiae and the everyday, of the horrendous distances between people, of the years and years we wait for things that we don’t want when we eventually get them. Reading Coupland in my early to mid twenties actively contributed to being a happy and healthy adult through sheer catharsis alone. Chuck Palahniuk is then to Douglas Coupland what Tom Holt is to Neil Gaiman.  <br /><br /><b>China Mieville</b> (M. John Harrison, HP Lovecraft)<br /><br />Mieville is the flagship author for the New Weird. The fun thing about the New Weird, though, is that it’s less weird than the Old Weird (Delaney, M. John Harrison, Robert W. Chambers, HPL), it’s just generally better written. In the unlikely event that I ever become a writer myself (outside of science) it’s pretty much inevitable that I’ll wind up somewhere between the New Weird and Magical Realism. Somewhere between Mieville, and…<br /><br /><b>Haruki Murakami</b> (Jack Kerouac, Andrey Kurkov)<br /><br />I’ve read every book of his bar two, and I’ll read those as well, most likely over chrumbletron. Murakami laid a mammoth and seismic hand on my entire life the moment I read the first story in After The Quake, and the only reason it hasn’t changed me utterly is because I was kind of already there. I’d been on the road with Jack Kerouac for quite some time before-hand, and Murakami was like a kink in the way that suddenly and inexplicably leads you right back to a home you’d completely forgotten you had. If Murakami WAS a place, it would be twinned with Kurkov, in the Ukraine. It’s a bleaker town, but at the same time it is much, much funnier.<br /><br /><b>Honourable Mentions</b><br /><br />Arundhati Roy, Vikram Seth, I have only read one or two books of yours each. Please publish more so that I can kick out one of the white bearded dudes. James Herbert, you are the only proper horror novelist I have consistently enjoyed (1974-1992), please stop sucking. It’s been ages. Poppy Z. Brite, I am going to pretend that Lost Souls was the only thing you ever wrote, or that someone else wrote it, and even so it is so trashy I can’t quite bring myself to list it as an influence, even if it maybe is. So thanks for that. Jeanette Winterson. Do I want to keep reading your stuff? I am unsure. Salman Rushdie, Susanna Clark, John Xero, I'm looking forward to reading a lot more of your material in the future, please keep it coming.<br /><br />*which, by the way, is totally not child-safe.<br />** yes, yes, I know Yeats was Irish and Milton English, that’s not the point.<br />*** I’ve also met Elizabeth Wurtzel off this list, but that didn’t result in anything useful because I was half utterly confounded by the whole thing, and half deeply angry at her. I’m not even sure why.
