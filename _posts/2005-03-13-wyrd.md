The Sisters live in London town nowadays, a ragtag and malignant trio of vagrant women. They squat like tumours halfway up the flanks of a tumbledown housing block. Cloaked in line upon line of washing, strung from wall to wall, layer upon layer of bead curtains, the doors long rusted off their hinges. They conceal themselves in halflight and steam, a colossal vat of ancient stew perpetually on the boil. Visitors, when they come, receive poisonously strong tea and soft old biscuits while the sisters tell them fortunes. Greater and yet not so great. Reading palms for silverware.

Rats pace along the skirting boards, roaches creep out at night. Pigeons blackened from nicotine addiction and smog masquerade as broken crows and roost upon the balcony. Times are hard in London town. Miles gone, the wood and the high hill. A hundred years and more have left the Sisters as creatures diminished and waiting. Waiting for tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. Drifting among the city spires as the weave of modern life hisses through the rain beneath, leaving parallel trails of growling light as it knits itself anew.
