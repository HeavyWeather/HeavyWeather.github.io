<i>1. What did you do in 2013 that you'd never done before?</i><br /><br />2012 was the year of the grand conjunction. Planets pulled into a line of bright light and shadow that year. Things could be done then that could never be done otherwise. If it was one in a hundred, this was the one. If you knew about it, you didn't do just one thing. You did all of the things. Vegas? Pocket change. Bungee jumping? More like it. Marriage? Absolutely. Big gambles and bank robberies, and countries exotic, all cosmically ego-powered in 2012.<br /><br />In 2013 I ate a lot of biscuits. Like, more than ever. There was some other stuff, but it was mostly about biscuits. <br /><br />It was a good year. <br /><br /><i>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</i><br /><br />Call your mother more. She worries. She worries that your time machine will work this year, or that you'll be made king of England, or that you'll wind up on Mars. She needs to know that you don't have more power than you can manage. She needs to know that she'll only get called-collect from the Moon.<br /><br /><i>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</i><br /><br />Everyone gives birth all of the time. There are tiny foetuses of probability on you right now. No, it's okay, they don't stain. No more than everything else. When you move, it shakes them free anyway. They fall and find fertile ground and then they breed. They breed like wildfire. They breed faster than anything else could even imagine. Rabbits wish they could multiply as quick, bacteria are reticent pandas by these standards. <br /><br />Eventually they do stop though. They're not great parasites. They still haven't learn how to keep the host alive, and then they die too. Sooner or later, there are just no more babies left.<br /><br /><i>4. Did anyone close to you die?</i><br /><br />This year we tried to murder death. The whole thing was silly. It just smiled at us and our weapons and then took everything we had, without even really moving much. Then it told us that it didn't feel like it yet, to come back next year, maybe. Times had been tough, apparently. It was rushed off its feet. It had to get going, it was sure we understood. It was already behind. It would see us later. We should come back again sometime. Definitely. Just in case. Then it mouthed "Call me", and did that thing with its fingers. The thing that looks a little like a telephone. <br /><br />Every time someone does that now, I kind of throw up a little, in my mouth. <br /><br /><i>5. What countries did you visit?</i><br /><br />Haggistan, Old Cheddarvia, Canuckstan, the Korean Multiplicity, Sanfran Cisco. I took a quick trip to Earth Two. It was weird. Mostly because all of the scales were off on everything. First the deep fryer settings were turned up too high, then pungency, ice density, multi-dimensionality, and corporate. The problem is, now I'm back I still can't get all of the twiddlers back into alignment. I think I went too far the other way with ice density. Corporate is still waaaay out of whack. Is Earth 1.4 a thing?<br /><br /><i>6. What would you like to have in 2014 that you lacked in 2013?</i><br /><br />A sense of hope for the competency and intentions of our political leaders would be nice.<br /><br /><i>7. What date from 2013 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</i><br /><br />The 4th of April was the day we finally managed to perfect the memory etching device. Or maybe it was the 5th. I mean, I'm not very good with dates, you know?<br /><br /><i>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</i><br /><br />I unlocked almost all of the achievements on the Eastcoast Rail Network, but the biggest one was definitely Sleeper Car Astronomer. I really need to stop doing all the passive exploration badges and start on some crafting ones though. I mean, besides Accidentally Paralytic Mead. That was a pretty weird achievement. <br /><br /><i>9. What was your biggest failure?</i><br /><br />All of my things are still in boxes. After about 30 years. There are just more boxes, full of more things. There are boxes with The Constellations When I Was A Kid spilling out. There are about five boxes of Heartbreak buried in there. Some of the boxes only have More Boxes in them. I don't know how many layers deep that goes. There's a box that has a list of most of the outer boxes in it, which is super useful, but I've been moving around even more than regular lately. There's a pretty thick layer of dust, building in among all that cardboard and wood, and it's old enough to get sticky. It's the dust, that's the failure.<br /><br /><i>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</i><br /><br />The fire of a thousand suns still burns inside my skin, but has no outlet. I need a disease. Some kind of sickness for my flesh. The warmth lurks inside, and keeps me from sleep. I need to burn it out on something that isn't just the progression from one hour to another. Please find me, influenza, please find me common cold. Please give me rest as I turn your million-strong multitude to ash. Those superheroes who heal from everything, they must never sleep at all. They must all be crazy.<br /><br /><i>11. What song will always remind you of 2013?</i><br /><br />The song of trams yet to be built. Trams that will never be built. A hiss-click litany of ghost trams from the future, empty forever. No trams in Leith, no trams at the airport. Only one tram, the one true tram, slowly shuffling from one end to another of a lonely disconnected test-track, unused. All promise, no purpose, aching for a reason to be. <br /><br /><i>12. Compared to this time last year, are you:</i><br /><br /><i>Happier or sadder</i> - The Sun has reached its latest maxima. It is smaller than the last. The next may be smaller still. We must immolate our bad days and poor intentions and shout, and dance, and goad that distant nuclear flame back to a stronger fire. The empty dark presses all around. The stakes are as high as they have ever been. Our failure is to come face to face with an unforgiving eternity. Our successes? More time bought in idle pleasures. More time to turn idle pleasures into our own sparks. More time to bury those sparks in rhythmically pounding engines of flesh. More time to scream into the dark, ever louder than before.<br /><br /><i>Older or wiser</i> - The second law: All things must fall apart. But finally, I have found a way to reverse time's arrow. I am the only creature in history to gain from it. Entropy builds my strength, I have corrupted it into something that has no word. I am un-named. I am free. One day, I will be the only animal in the garden. And then, then I will finally meet god.
