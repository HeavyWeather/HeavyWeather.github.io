<p>My music tastes have changed a lot since, but these were all important to me during my teens, like close siblings ought to be, and I still love them.

</p><p>1980 was the year that goth really got going. Between seminal releases by Siouxsie Sioux, The Cure, the next band mentioned here, and Bauhaus, something had clearly gone a bit wrong with British music. At the time, NME called Bauhaus "Doom for Doom's sake", which pretty much sums up the entirety of the genre that would spring theatrically from Daniel Ash's utterly over the top lyrics and posturing. This is the man responsible for 'Bela Lugosi's dead" and who, during their recent reunion tour, sang the whole nine minutes or so hanging upside down like a bat. Having said all that, the bass line to In The Flat Field is just unstoppable, and impossible to erase from your brain once it's in there, both disaffected and desperate. I spent most of my adolescence in the flat, agricultural part of Lincolnshire known as the Fens before moving to London. Although I've never had the pleasure of a Picadilly whore, this song is one of my all time favourites, because it's from the same place that I am.

</p><p>You can't write about the music of 1980 without referencing Joy Division. 1980 is the year that saw Love Will Tear Us Apart filmed and released either side of Ian Curtis' untimely death, with the album Closer available shortly afterward as Joy Division's opus. Both of the tracks I've posted here are covers, because although I don't actually like Joy Division that much musically, their lyrics are amazing, and they undeniably shaped decades of music. The first is by The Cure, who kind of picked up where Ian Curtis left off, midway through 1980, with their album Seventeen Seconds. Somehow, I don't think Robert Smith would have been quite so heavy with the eyeliner if not for Joy Division. The second cover is by Therapy? from the magnificent album Troublegum, a record Ian Curtis would be proud of.

<p><a href="http://www.theclashonline.com/">The Clash</a> | <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/cfajz8qp8f">London Calling</a>
</p><p>I'm cheating here, because this was released in the UK in 1979, and in the US in 1980. I'm posting it anyway because whereas the tracks above shaped music to come, this reflects what had gone before, and 1980 was very much a year between times. London Calling is both of, and about, the capital in almost any way that matters. It has lyrics that will never die, 30 seconds or so of sheer guitar feedback bliss (howling in around 1:51), Joe Strummer doing an eerily good impression of the Tower ravens (2: 05ish), and very nearly the best ending to any song ever. If I eventually have children, and find that London Calling isn't in their mp3000 collection by age 15, I'm taking them out back and putting them out of my misery.

</p><p>While The Clash had Britain by the balls (even if they didn't really know it), The DKs were marauding across the States causing deliberate uproar at every turn. They pissed off the record industry, politicians a plenty, and even the BBC. Jello Biafra's lisping sarcasm is immediately unforgetable, inimitable, and unlike many other punk bands of the time, frighteningly intelligent. Black Flag were never really any threat to anyone but themselves due to their innate introspection, but the Dead Kennedys looked outward, not inward, and were once christened "the most dangerous band in the world". Their 1980 debut also happens to be fast, aggressive, and catchy as all hell. Here's the out and out meanest track from that album, the opening of which makes me want to punch things within seconds, and the track they substituted for it when asked to play the 1980 Bay Area music awards. Careful kids, the DKs make Marilyn Manson and Eminem both look like unruly first graders.

</p><p>Most Sabbath fans have a favourite period. For my sins, and with tongue placed firmly in cheek, mine is the reign of Ronnie James Dio, first midget of rock. Dani Filth maybe almost as tiny, but he has nothing on the man who reputedly popularised Manu Cornata (aka, throwing the horns), on the 1980 tour of the album from which this is the title track, and who wore skin tight snakeskin pants long before the use of PVC as trouser making material. Whereas Dani can barely manage a vaguely malicious croak, RJD belts out tune after tune in almost operatic fashion. I've seen him live (yes, he's still touring), and on stage the man is HUGE. This is Dio at his mightiest, with Sabbath on -fire- under his command.</p>
