Last week all I could of told you about Indonesia is that its a bit volcanic, they grow coffee and the East Indian Trading Company had a base there... There's a mind boggling fact, its made up of almost 18000 islands. I can't get my head around a country made up of that many islands!<br /><br />Anyway down to food. Quite a common meal in Indonesia is what's called a rijsttafel which is Dutch for rice table (Indonesia was a Dutch colony). It consists of a main rice dish served with several meat / vegetables / egg dishes, sambals (condiment), pickled vegetables all served together rather than in separate courses.<br /><br />Either all the Indonesian recipes online have been doctored or Indonesian folk are hard-core. Their food is loaded with chilli's, your like cartoon jaw-drop "how many chilli's ???". Most of the recipes below have been cooked with 1/2 to 1/3 of the suggested number of chilli's in them!<br /><br />Kecap Manis (Sweat Soya Sauce) <small><a href="http://www.recipes4us.co.uk/Accompaniments/Sweet%20Indonesian%20Soy%20Sauce%20%20%20Veg%20%20CD%20%20ACC%20%20%20%20Indonesian%20%2020mins%20plus%20cooling.htm">based upon this recipe</a></small><br />50g Dark Brown Sugar<br />60ml Water<br />50ml Dark Soy Sauce<br />1 slug of Pernod<br />1 Garlic Clove, chopped<br />2 tsp Galangal<br /><br />I really monkeyed with this using several recipes I found online. Also I was lacking a few ingredients, such as replacing star anise with a slug of Pernod - well they do sort of take a like (^_~).<br /><br />Place all ingredients in saucepan and bring to the boil stirring frequently. Turn down and simmer for 5 minutes.<br /><br /><br />Nasi Goreng (Fried Rice) <small><a href="http://asiarecipe.com/indoveg3.html#nasi">based upon this recipe</a></small><br />75g Long grain rice per person<br />8 Shallots<br />1 chilli<br />2 tbs Kecap Manis<br />1 tbs Tomato Puree<br />Oil<br />Salt<br /><br />Boil the rice with least amount of water possible and leave to cool for a few hours. Fry the shallots and chilli until soft. Add the remaining ingredients and stir fry for 8 to 10 minutes making sure it doesn't stick.<br /><br /><br />Tomato Sambal <small><a href="http://www.recipes4us.co.uk/Salsas%20and%20Rel/Tomato%20Sambal%20%20%20Veg%20%20CD%20%20ACC%20%20Indonesian%20%2030mins.htm">from this recipe</a></small><br /><br />This is really nice and not as spicy as you think. I actually left if cooking longer than planned and the onions caramelised beautifully. I think this would actually make a lovely burger relish or pasta dressing.<br /><br />I cook a couple of sate dishes, the recipes listed two sate sauces a <a href="http://www.recipes4us.co.uk/Sauces/Traditional%20Sate%20%20Sauce%20%20%20Veg%20HT%20%20CD%20%20ACC%20%20Indonesian%20%2030mins.htm">traditional one</a> and an <a href="http://www.recipes4us.co.uk/Sauces/Easy%20Peanut%20Sate%20Sauce%20%20%20Veg%20HT%20%20ACC%20%20Indonesian%2010mins.htm">easy one</a>. As you'd expect I chose the traditional one, next time I'll use the easy one. It might not be as authentic, but it would really be so easy and you need a bloody good blender to make the traditional one. Mine can't grind peanuts fine enough.<br /><br />Traditional Sate Sauce<br />225g Raw Peanuts<br />2 Garlic Cloves, chopped<br />1/2 Onion, chopped<br />1/2 tsp Chilli Paste<br />1/2 tsp Brown Sugar<br />1 tbsp Kecap Manis<br />480ml  Water<br />1 tsp Lemon Juice<br />2 tsp Peanut Butter<br /><br />Dry bake the peanuts until they start to turn golden. Grind them as smoothly as possible. Fry the onion and garlic until soft. Add the rest of the ingredients. Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes.<br /><br />We used the sauce on the following dishes, but there was so much we had a bowl left over. Its surprisingly good as a dip for crisps or on bread.<br /> <br />Pork Sate <small><a href="http://www.recipes4us.co.uk/Pork%20and%20Bacon/Grilled%20Pork%20Sate%20%20%20HT%20%20MC%20%20Indonesian%20%2020mins%20plus%20marinating.htm">from this recipe</a></small><br />Tuna Sate <small><a href="http://www.recipes4us.co.uk/Poultry%20and%20Game/Indonesian%20Chicken%20Sate%20%20%20%20HT%20%20MC%20%20Indonesian%20%2025mins%20plus%20marinating.htm">using this recipe (but replacing the chicken)</a></small><br /><br />Sumatran Eggs <small><a href="http://www.recipes4us.co.uk/VegetarianMC/Sumatran%20Eggs%20%20%20%20Veg%20%20HT%20%20MC%20%20Indonesian%20%2020mins.htm">from this recipe (but with one chilli instead of four)</a></small><br />This is really very strange looking - had boiled eggs in a bright yellow sauce. It tastes much better than it sounds!
