I do love Middle Eastern food and one of my favourite local restaurants is Lebanese.<br /><br />My initial decision was to cook something I'd never tried before, but quickly I realised that if I was going to include a mezze element this would be impossible. Traditionally Middle Eastern meals start with mezze which either comes from the Arabic meaning to nibble food or Persian meaning tasty. Its a number of small dishes served with pita prior to the main dish, though to make things easier for myself I served everything at once.<br /><br />For the mezze element I eventually decided on too common dishes - Foul (of Fool) Moudamas, a dip made from broad beans, lemon juice and garlic, also Baba Ghanoush, a dip made from aubergines, tahini and lemon juice. These were accompanied with warm pita bread cut into strips.<br /><br />For the main element the vast number of artichoke recipes I found online really appealed to me. I enjoy the depth of flavour that comes with artichokes and I'd never cook with fresh artichokes. Unfortunately I couldn't find a single store that stocked fresh artichokes. Regardless I decided upon Artichoke Mehshe, which is artichokes stuff with lamb served with what several recipe websites called Lebanese rice.<br /><br />All recipe quantities below serve two people.<br /><br />Foul Moudamas: <small><a href="http://www.lebaneserecipes.com/FoolMoudamas.htm">based upon this recipe</a></small><br />1 tin of broad beans<br />80 ml lemon juice<br />4 cloves of garlic, crushed<br />Generous amount of Salt & pepper<br /><br />Simmer the beans for an hour or until the skins are reasonably soft. This is important as broad bean skins are reasonably tough. Blend the beans with the rest of the ingredients and salt and pepper to taste. Chill before serving.<br /><br />Notes: The next time I make this I'm going to cook the beans for longer and use less lemon juice.<br /><br /><br /><br />Baba Ghanoush: <small><a href="http://www.lebaneserecipes.com/BabaGhanoush.htm">based upon this recipe</a></small><br />1 aubergine<br />2 tbs tahini<br />2 tbs lemon juice<br />2 tbs yoghurt<br />2 cloves of garlic, crushed<br />4 tbs olive oil<br />Generous amount of Salt & pepper<br />Fresh coriander, roughly chopped<br /><br />Slit the skin of the aubergine and cook under a moderate grill, turn until all sides blackened. Peel the aubergine once cool and blend with the remaining ingredients. Chill before serving.<br /><br />Notes: If your squeamish do wear gloves to peel the aubergine, the texture really is disgusting.<br /><br /><br /><br />Artichoke Mehshe: <small><a href="http://www.lebaneserecipes.com/ArtichokeMehshe.htm">based upon this recipe</a></small><br />1 tin of artichokes, drained<br /><br />Filling:<br />1 onion, chopped<br />150g minced lamb<br />50g pine nuts<br />4 tbs olive oil<br />2 tsp mixed spices *<br />Generous amount of Salt & pepper<br /><br />Sauce:<br />2 tbs olive oil<br />3 tbs lemon juice<br />1 tsp mixed spices *<br />50g vegetable stock<br />50g pasata<br />3 tbs flour<br /><br />Fry the onion and half the oil over a moderate heat until it starts to soften, then add the pine nuts. Don't add the pine nuts at the start as they could burn before the onions are soft. Fry for a further minute then add the lamb. Once the lamb is cooked grease the bottom of a casserole dish with the remaining oil, add the artichokes and cover with the lamb.<br /><br />Warm the oil for the sauce over a moderate heat, add flour and spices as if making a white sauce. Mix the stock, pasata and lemon juice in a jug then slowly stir into the pan. If the sauce get too runny add a little more flour. Pour over the lamb and bake in a preheated oven at 180C.<br /><br />* The Lebanese Recipes website describes this as Allspice, Black pepper, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmeg, Fenugreek and Ginger. I had everything but allspice in the cupboard. Given the combination of spices its actually surprisingly aromatic without being too strong.<br /><br /><br />Notes: This is the recipe I changed the most. The original recipe suggested making the sauce with just the water used to cook the artichokes. Whilst I could have used the liquid from the can I thought that it would end up rather bland.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lebanese Rice: <small><a href="http://mideastfood.about.com/od/ricerecipes/r/lebaneserice.htm">based upon this recipe</a></small><br /><br />100g rice<br />50g vermicelli, broken to very small pieces<br /><br />Boil for twenty minutes or until rice cooked.<br /><br />Notes: I didn't bother to brown the vermicelli as I was pushed for time and this odd dish came out surprisingly well. Only thing to remember is to break up that pasta!<br /><br /><center><br /><img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/ghostflight/pic/000kq3s4"><br /></center><br /><br />Links:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lebaneserecipes.com">Lebanese Recipes</a><br /><a href="http://mideastfood.about.com/">Middle Eastern Foods</a><br /><a href="http://www.recipesource.com/ethnic/africa/middle-east/lebanese/">Recipe Source</a><br /><a href="http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/9101/lebanese_recipes.html">Lebanese Recipes</a><br /><a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/r/236">Recipe Zaar</a><br /><a href="http://www.lebmania.com/recipes/">LebMania Recipes</a>
