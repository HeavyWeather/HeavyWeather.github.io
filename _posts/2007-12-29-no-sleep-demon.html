<p>It's just gone half four in the morning here, and for the first time in a long time, I'm finding that I still can't sleep. I've just spent half an hour or so looking for a setlist Cam and I played almost 4 years ago. Before that I went searching for a few tracks I've lost through crash after crash, rejigging data over and again. I'm tired enough that I'm experiencing that lag between when you shift focus, and when your brain catches up to let you actually see. When you're roughly aware of your own pulse without laying fingers to a vein.</p>
<p>This is what happens when I'm not busy, when I've been sleeping solidly, but not from exhaustion. I'd forgotten what it was like. </p>
<p>I have the whole of the <a href="http://www.brightweavings.com/books/fionavar.htm">fionavar tapestry</a> next to my bed. If this goes on much longer, I guess I'll see dawn in around the edges of a book.</p>
