Due to shops being a little foolish, I was a little pushed for ingredients. Even so, I found Germany to be surprisingly easy and the results are very hearty (if very brown). As we're fairly familiar with German sausages and the like, I thought I'd dig out some traditional dishes that were a little unusual, if still very meat based. Certainly, I wasn't sure it would quite work together, but well, I had no complaints!<br /><br />Again, ordered for ease of preperation:<br /><br /><b>Rindsrouladen</b><br />4  slices beef top round steak (1/2-inch thick)<br />salt and pepper, to taste<br />prepared mustard<br />3  small onions, finely chopped<br />3  slices bacon, chopped<br />1  large dill pickles/gherkin, sliced<br />1  tablespoon vegetable shortening (if you have any)<br />1 1/2 cups beef stock<br />1  tablespoon flour<br /><br />1. Season the beef slices with salt and pepper, and then spread thinly with mustard. When I say thinly, I don't mean, 'turn the meat a bit yellow'. You want a thin -covering- of mustard. <br />2. mix together 2 of the chopped onions, bacon, and gherkin, and sprinkle the mix evenly across the steak. Then roll them up and secure with skewers, toothpicks or string. I can recommend the string option, and the aid of a trusty friend, as it might take more than one pair of hands.<br />3. Heat the shortening in a biiiiig pan. Add the beef rolls; saute until well browned, turning occasionally. Add the remaining onion; saute until light golden brown. Add the stock. Add pretty much any booze you like (red wine works, beer works, or my favourite choice- hock). Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br />4. Cover and simmer the above for about 1 hour. To thicken sauce, combine (thoroughly) flour and a small amount of booze. Stir flour mixture into cooking liquid. Cook, stirring, until slightly thickened. <br /><br />To the above you can merrily add german meatballs, which are amongst the easiest things on earth to cook:<br /><br /><b>Meatballs</b><br />1 lb. lean ground beef     <br />1/2 tsp. salt<br />1/8 tsp. pepper<br />1/4 tsp. sage<br />2 tbsp. all-purpose flour<br />1 tbsp. fine dry bread crumbs<br />1 egg <br /><br />Mix together everything but the egg. Beat the egg slightly and then add that too. Knead the lot together. Shape into balls, dump into the above about 15-20 minutes before it's done, turn about every 5 minutes. Done.<br /><br />And finally, something from the German agricultural marketing board that by all rights should be minging, but is -awesome-.<br /><br /><b>Heaven and Earth (Himmel und Erde)</b><br />1 lb floury potatoes<br />4-5 tart dessert apples, peeled and sliced<br />1 tablespoon butter<br />1 tablespoon oil<br />5 slices bacon<br />1 large onion, chopped<br />sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /><br />1. Boil the potatoes as if you were going to make mash. I like to leave them a little bit solid so that the mash is nice and chunky, but some people prefer to cook them to death and wind up with a very creamy thing.<br />2. While your potatoes are resting, whack your bacon under the grill (if you want it crispy, my choice), or in a pan with some butter (if you prefer it fatty). <br />3. Meanwhile cook the apples in about 4 tablespoons of water with a little butter, stirring occasionally until they break down to a puree, just as if you were going to make apple sauce. Except...<br />4. Season the apple puree with salt and pepper (yes, I know it's odd, but go with it) and then mash the potatoes -into- it. Mix the two properly, add a good chunk of butter, and season well. Set aside to keep warm.<br />5. Heat some oil in a frying pan and saute the onions until soft and golden. Then add both the onions and the bacon to the appley mash, mix well, check for seasoning and butter, and serve!<br /><br />If you're going to do the above, make sure you have something with sauce with it, as otherwise you might need to add a little milk to the mix. Apparently it goes very well with blood sausage, which I can thoroughly believe, but I couldn't get hold of any. As a combination of two of my favourite things ever (apple sauce and mash) I will definitely be cooking this again, particularly during the depths of the coming winter.
