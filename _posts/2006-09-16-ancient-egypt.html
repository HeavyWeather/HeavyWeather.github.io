After hours online / in the library I can safely its impossible to cook food from the time of the Pharaohs. There isn't a single recorded recipe, not even the secret recipe for flaming hippo steaks dabbed on a pit of papyrus and taken to the afterlife.<br /><br />The British Museum might have publish an ancient Egyptian recipe book, but they were <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.food.cooking/msg/7d63609e4287ad4b">lying!</a> (^_~)<br /><br />So, time for plan b (not pizza, that's plan c!) - something that would be in the spirit of it! I've got a rough idea of what ingredients archaeologists think were available. Rough because so many sources contradict each other, but here goes:<br /><ul><br /><li>Beer and Bread, well not ingredients as such, but the main component of all meals, every rich and poor a like ate it. Given that I love bread, beer and guys in eyeliner, ancient Egypt rox!<br /><p>This has also spawned by favourite ancient quotes:<br /><code><br />      The mouth of a perfectly contented man is filled with beer.<br /><br />      -- 2200 BC inscription<br /><br />      [She] sent you to school when you were ready to be taught writing, and she waited for you daily at home with bread and beer.<br /><br />      -- Instructions of Ani, regarding his mother </code> XD</li><br /><li>Vegetables - Chickpeas, Lentils, Peas, Leeks, Garlic, Onions, Cucumber, Endive, Lotus root and Taro. Garlic and Onions especial important as the Egyptians as they were good for you health / repel diseases.</li><br /><li>Fruit - Dates, Figs, Grapes / Raisins, Pomegranates,  Watermelons, Olives, Carob</li><br /><li>Nuts - Walnuts, Almonds, Pistachio (these seem to be the most contradictory)</li><br /><li>Meat - Duck, Geese, Quail, Cranes, Beef (but only for the very rich), Pork (really does vary on what age, eg at times it was linked with Seth, therefore evil), Fish from the Nile although a number were connected to Osiris so never eaten. I didn't write any down because they were all impossible to get in the supermarket, catfish being the most likely.</li><br /><li>Dairy - some evidence of the consumption of milk and cheese, but not a lot.</li><br /><li>Spices - Aniseed, Cinnamon, Coriander, Dill, Fennel, Fenugreek, Marjoram, Mustard, Rosemary and Thyme. A few of these were contradictory especially salt it seems 50/50 as to its use from what I've read, again linked to Seth</li><br /></ul><br /><br />Big no's really are sugar (honey was used), chickens (simply weren't in Egypt at that time) and major use of eggs. As one site put it, the poultry they had access to didn't have the laying power of chickens therefore it seems more likely that they raised the birds for food instead.<br /><br />Right down to food! I've taken bit of Egyptian food, mixed them up with restrictions and come up with these recipes. So in no way are the authentic, but hopefully tasty!<br /><br /><b>Duck on a bed of figs and lemon</b><br /><small>Hopefully this is vaguely like something you could have at a banquet, it should be rich enough!</small><br /><i>Serves: 3</i><br />3 portions of duck<br />6 fresh figs<br />4 tbl D'ua<br />1 large onion<br />4 cloves of garlic<br />3 tbl lemon juice<br />3 tsp Coriander seeds<br />3 tsp cinnamon<br />fresh rosemary sprigs minced<br />water<br /><br />Carefully toast the almonds on a baking tray and leave to cool. Wash and figs and lemon. Remove the woody stalk from the figs. Along with the lemon cut into thick slices and arrange in the bottom of an oiled casserole dish. Dice onion, crush and mince garlic then add to casserole dish with the remaining ingredients, add the duck last. Add a little water until it just covers the vegetables / figs. Periodically top up the water as it cook, but not too much! Cook at 180C until the juices run clear. <br /><br />To serve remove the duck and skim off any oil. Ladle over the fig and lemon sauce, adjust consistency with cornflower as required. <br /><br /><b>Fattoush</b><br /><small>Fattoush sprung to mind with the bread connection. Its not really fattoush given the lack of ingredients, but you get the idea...</small><br /><i>Serves: 3</i><br />1 fenel<br />1/2 cucumber<br />1/2 can of chickpeas <br />1/2 can of peas<br />3 tbl olives<br />1 small onion<br />2 cloves of garlic<br />2 tbl oil<br />2 tbl lemon juice<br />4 slices whole grain bread<br />rosemary<br /><br />Combine all salad ingredients and refrigerate. Just before serving toast the bread and toss with the salad.<br /><br /><b>Humus</b><br /><small>Such a popular Mediterranean condiment it seems like they could have eaten something like it</small><br />1 tin of chickpeas<br />1 lemon, juice of<br />3 cloves of garlic<br />2 tbl tahini<br />4 tbl olive oil<br />salt<br /><br />Cook the chickpeas until completely soft. Blend all ingredients.<br /><br /><b>D'ua</b><br /><small>This is an Egyptian recipe adapted slightly to make it more like a dip</small><br />150g pistachio nuts<br />150g almonds<br />1 tbl coriander seeds<br />1 tbl cumin seeds<br />1/2 tsp thyme<br />60g sesame seeds<br />oil to dip bread in before dipping in this<br /><br />Toast the nuts and seeds, this will need to be done individually as they toast at different speeds, then leave to cool. Blend all ingredients roughly.<br /><br /><b>Griddle Bread</b><br /><small>I came across a reference that Egyptian griddle bread looks a lot like modern Nubian griddle bread. Of course could I find a recipe for that!? Could I hell, so after looking at more recipes that you can shake a stick as, I went for <a href="http://www.astray.com/recipes/?show=Griddle%20bread">this one</a>, just so I could use goats milk yougurt because I've never used it for anything before</small><br /><pre>

Heat griddle or heavy pan to a moderate temperature, dust the base lightly with flour. Place dough on griddle. Turn after five minutes. continue to cook, turning as necessary,until centre is set. The pan may be covered to produce softer bread. Split and butter to serve . good Warm or cold. Preparation time 7 minutes Cooking time 8-10 minutes.<br /><br />Now it does seem more that a little foolish to post recipes I've made up but never tried cooking first! So check back tomorrow to see how they turned out!!
