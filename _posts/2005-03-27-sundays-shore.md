We're walking down by the lake. The heat makes us sluggish but it dulls the pain a little. We could sit around, get drunk, but it's only been two days. If the others feel like I do, feel like his memory is still a tangible thing, it would feel wrong, like a betrayal. We're too familiar with betrayal. It weighs us down enough without further insult. Like we were trees, branches bowed, littered with swinging rope and corpses.

This is how we are. Strung out, tired... more than a little afraid. no-one wants to say it, but everyone wonders if their name was part of the bargain. Everyone knows what might happen. We were never prepared for the horror of it, and now it stalks us all... bloody tattered hands grasping at our heels.

Some of us talk quietly about it, about nothing, about him, or them. Some of us just weep... I remain silent. I'm too shocked for anything else. Thoughts skitter at the edges of my mind, but nothing stays still long enough, is solid enough, for me to grip.

Mark walks aside. Distant in every respect, it hurts. I look at him now and then, but he doesn't notice me. Mark doesn't seem to notice much at all; stumbling, scuffing his feet. I worry, change my path toward him, catch up to him in a quiet moment. But it's a long time before he looks up. I drink in Mark's gaze, his attention, and it's longer before I see that he's smiling. It's faint, but strong for being so utterly calm.

'It's going to be okay,' he whispers, I can only nod, weakly.

'it's going to be fine...' His eyes have drifted to focus far away, but his words cover the distance,

'He's coming back.'
