There is fog on the water out in Sleepness Bay. Behind it, the town is defined by peaks and rooves, before dropping into a grey vagueness. There are streets in there, and houses and lives, but in the washed out morning light, they are undefined. The further back they are, the less present they seem, the more they are caught and unavailable in tangles of brick and concrete, made fluid by nothing more substantial than water in the air. Like the beach as it slips beneath the waves. There are surfaces here, beyond which things are indistinct. Under the water, back from the shore. Inside those houses and within each alley. And this is the way Sleepiness always is, fog or no. There are places inside the heads of the people who live here which are unknown, but joined up. There are territories that are hard to grasp, but complete.

Since long before the war, since the days before the town could even be considered a town, Sleepness has been a place of shadowy multiple. It is a place that dozes, but dreams deep, and long, and moves together as one body. It has its own ocean, untouchable and no more substantial than water in the air. Except in moments of duress, or on the edges of death, or unconsciousness.

This is a story about that place, and not the town that can be seen when the fog lifts.
