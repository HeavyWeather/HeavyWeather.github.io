title: 'Bonus Recipe: Vegan Chilli'
---

I've had a request for the recipe for my Vegan (ie contains zero animal based ingredients) chilli. Its very imprecise as I tend to make it by eye, usually drunk.<br /><br />Vegan chilli - serves 4<br />1 onion, chopped<br />3 cloves garlic, crushed and minced<br />1/2 Scotch bonnet chilli, seeds removed and chopped<br />1 carton of Pasata<br />6 handfulls of Holland and Barret falvoured soya chunks<br />generious shake of cocoa powder<br />2 heaped tbs of Marmite<br />generious sprinkle of mixed herbs<br />(optionally 2 tsp cumin and corriander if I have any dry fried and ground)<br /><br />Fry the onion, garlic  and chilli until soft. Add the pasata and soya chunks, cook over a moderate heat until the chunks start to soften. Add the herbs, cocoa powder and marmite. Leave to simmer stirring occasionally for at least 10 minutes.
