<p>So, this week, all manner of goblinry has occured. Helping me to document the goblinry, I've found myself a shiny new camera (as those of you reading this on <a href="http://www.icememory.net/">im.net</a>, or following my long-defunct now resurrected <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/umbriel/">flickr</a>, will be able to see), which is very nice. I've kind of wanted one since I got here, but I've been relying on Alix's old and beaten up box of frustration due to a lack of funds.</p>
<lj-cut text="read more"><p> Disposable income has finally shown up (ish), and with it I've picked up an <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/product.asp?product=1287">Olympus 770sw</a>, even though <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alixsquish/">Alix</a> has just replaced the relic with her own shiny box o'glee . There were fairly mixed reviews of the 770 on the interweeble, but I have to say that I love it... so far. The battery life is fairly immense, I've totally overdone it with the memory card (1145 photos available?!?) because they're despicably cheap ($45ca for 2gig), and I find the menu system pretty intuitive to navigate. The picture quality is much better than I was expecting it to be, and the zoom is fairly mad (3x optical, 5x digital, 15x combined). The reason I went for the 770 though (and they're not cheap) is that it's supposed to be fairly indestructable. Waterproof, crushproof, shockproof, freezeproof, should pretty much make it meproof, even if I do decide to take it snowboarding this winter. I have yet to dunk it, jump on it, throw it, or jam it in the icecube maker though, so we'll have to wait and see. Immediately after buying my camera I also found a little place just round the corner from my house that does fantastic mango lhassi, my favourite drink of all time, so all in all, it was a pretty good day. I didn't take a picture of it, but <a href="http://michel-lacombe.dyndâ€‹ns.org">Michel</a>, inadvertently, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=352587&amp;id=623275128&amp;ref=mf">did</a>.</p>
<p>What I did take a lot of photos of, was a night out to Mad Hatters, Montreal's nearest metal pub, which did result in some shots that were much nicer than anything i've ever done before (bodes well). Having said that, I was like a sugared-up child with a brand new toy, so out of the 20 or so snaps I took, one or two had to turn out well, really. Further experimentation unfortunately continued to prove that I remain enormously un-photogenic. It also provided proof the Noah's camera can outshine the sun, and vastly out-do mine in terms of flash, but I tried pretty hard to blind him anyway. When chatting to him later, I discovered that he has a couple of metal plates and a handful of screws in his arm, from a snowboarding accident. So that's encouraging.</p>
<p>Saturday was a little bit of a sad day, partially because of the hang-over of dhoom (apparently simple drinking games are officially the worst of all), but more because of pretty much finishing off the appartment rape that we'd started on Thursday. Although we are gaining a lot of stuff (including comics), none of it will really serve to replace the yawning gap (because he's a tall man) that will appear when James, my first Montreal based friend, disappears for parts distant on some kind of crazy globe trotting adventure. Then again... he's clearly going to have a fantastic time, so I'm more than a little bit jealous. The easily-swayed part of my brain is now scheming ways to save enough money that i can take six months of similar travel when my contract here ends, rather than actually having some funds in my pocket. What isn't helping that is Facebook. Lots of my friends from UCL are popping up, and it's becoming clear that we span the globe. The only way that I'm ever going to see all of them is if I do a bit of trotting myself. That, or exercise my evil powers of hypnosis to get them here instead. Moo-ha-ha. Another sad part about James' nigh departure is that I will have to find a new sushi buddy. After Operation Enduring Tidy we discovered a new kind of sushi at Kanda (dragon's eye, is -nummy-), and I'm definitely going back to the place we went that I...totally... can't remember the name of... . But again, it won't be the same.</p>
<p>Sunday was a slow day, highlighted by home made lasagne and a trip to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts to see their Streamlined exhibition. Think 1920s-50s futurama tech (the style, not the cartoon, heathens), and you're there. I do now want a ride on an enormous cruise liner submarine though, please. And an antigrav, hydrogen powered, Arlen Ness designed motorbike. <a href="http://everythingandnothing.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/ness5.jpg">Thank you</a>. After all, if <a href="http://www.bmwworld.com/hydrogen/stragegy.htm">BMW</a> have started touting themselves as producers of clean cars, anything's possible.</p>
