Chaxie is waiting for Kmyre to wake up. Chaxie is waiting for his  throbbing flesh to heal: just so he can hit his comatose friend again.  Right now that's all that's on Chaxie's mind. Chaxie is determined  like that. Chaxie is focussed on that one thing. Even though his  chitin is broken where he hit him last time, Chaxie is waiting.  Chaxie will wait all night long if he has to.

<!--more-->Passed out on the rubble, Kmyre is nothing much of anything. Kmyre is  floating on the edges of concussion, bruises pressing down on his  eyes. He has nothing dreams, lying at the bottom of the dark and  looking up through the blues and greens that swim in his out-cold vision. His lungs tell him that everything hurts, that everything is  swollen to injured proportion, but the message isn't getting through.  The signal looks around bewildered at the absence of its master.

Out in the waking world, the hulking crustacean glares at his friend  and idly cleans his mouth parts. Chaxie is huge by anyone's  standards. He is big even for a captain of the Night Brigade. He is  big, and mean, and most importantly of all, he is patient. Chaxie  will stand here, switching weight in the manner of his change,  flexing soft and pale flesh inside his armour. Wind-chime piercings  moaning in the breeze, aching round his articulated fists for another  chance to knock Kmyre into the dark. Resisting the urge to just clip  off a limb. Chaxie's hearing is unnaturally poor, but it doesn't  matter, her name is almost ambient. Her absence, unavoidable. Every  broken surface is a sound mirror for the whispered syllable,  directing and amplifying it to a point that swells and lulls around  the two. When Chaxie stares at Kmyre, it's through the distortion  that the word provides, wavering the air between them. Chaxie doesn't  really care about Kmyre's fever, or babbling, or the marshlight in  the back of his gaze. Chaxie doesn't care that he's alone save the  suddenly maddened creature before him, and corpses. All Chaxie thinks  about is how she's dead. How Kmyre's fangs are still damp with her.  All Chaxie sees are bared teeth, feral fury, and a face not commanded  by it's own.

As the child gasps, reaches a hand to his face and comes upright,  Chaxie is suddenly upon him. Kmyre hurriedly screams out words bent  by lisping, 'The Wolf is coming! The Wolf!' But even as he snarls and  twists out of shape, Chaxie has already punched Kmyre senseless, gone into the deep again. Chaxie will pound Kmyre over  and over again if need be. Kmyre will live passed out on the rubble,  concussed and ugly, his guardian focussed on solitude beneath the  hunting moon.

Sooner or later the Night Brigade will find them. The Sideways Magi  will come droning, the boy will have his mind torn from him, and the  Wolf will pay their charge. Then, and only then, will Chaxie kill Kmyre.
