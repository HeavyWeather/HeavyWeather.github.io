Surely, I thought to myself, surely there must be more to the local cuisine than setting fire to dead things. With that in mind I went hunting, and my first avenue of inquiry was my longsuffering friend, ex-sparring partner, and now aussie-immigrant, Kat. This is what she had to say:<br /><br />"Pavlova! Or just tim-tams.  They sell 'em in Tescos and they're a bit like<br />Penguins (the biscuits).  Bite the top and bottom off and suck coffee<br />through them.  Lovely.  Not so much for those of you that don't drink<br />coffee of course, but I can't be pandering to such wierdness."<br /><br />Less than entirely helpful, and hardly what you might describe as gourmet. So, next stop, the BBC, and... Nothing. Nadda. I was stunned. In a slightly dazed state I drifted aimlessly around the internet, stumbling upon a webring entirely devoted to australian food <a href="http://pub38.bravenet.com/sitering/show.php?usernum=3215407097" rel="nofollow">bloggers</a>, all of whom eat out almost every night and consume very little apart from Oriental food, and Italian. Informational websites claim that Australian national dishes include:<br /><br />o Pavlova<br />o Lamingtons (a kind of cookie)<br />o ANZAC biscuits<br />o Vegemite sandwiches<br />o And lo and behold, coffee sucked through a Tim Tam<br /><br />For quite a while I thought I was being useless, but then I found out that: "<a href="http://www.convictcreations.com/culture/foodwine.htm" rel="nofollow">Australia</a> has few meals that are recognised as Australian and which can be found in the majority of Australian households." Further, that Aussie food can be divided into suburban favourites (the above), "modern Australian", which is a fusion kind of thing that mashes together the cultures of almost every immigrant community on the continent, and bush food, eaten by australian cowboys and native aborigines depending on how far you go into the bush (so to speak). As I'd been charged with Australian food, rather than the bastard offspring of Japan and Italy, I went straight for the bush.<br /><br />All of the following is enough to feed 3 fairly hungry individuals, but most of it requires some hot (white) coals. I finally found a weeny disposable barbeque at the local grocery store, then got my (progressively more drunk) girlfriend to light it and look after it until the flames died down. By which stage I was fairly drunk too.<br /><br /><br />Chilli Beer Damper <small><a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/33240" rel="nofollow">based upon this recipe</a></small><br />6  	cups plain flour<br />6 	teaspoons baking powder<br />2 	teaspoons salt<br />4 	teaspoons sugar<br />2 	red chilies (you can leave in the seeds if you're not a pussy)<br />1 1/3   cans of beer. Any kind will do but we decided on Fosters for authenticity. <br />2/3     can of beer<br /><br />This recipe is simply stunning. Just whizz all of the above (except the last 2/3 can of beer) in a big bowl, adjust the amount of beer or flour if it looks too gloopy or is too stiff (though you should be okay), spoon it into a greased (rubbed with butter will do nicely) inch and a half deep baking tray, smooth off, and then leave it in a preheated oven at about 350F/170C for an hour. While you're waiting, drink the remaining 2/3 of beer.<br /><br />Notes: I was bowled over by a.) how well this worked considering how easy it is and b.) the scope for changing the recipe to include almost anything you want. <a href="http://www.e-commkitchen.com/recipes/cuisineofworld/australian.htm" rel="nofollow">Moths</a> for instance. We were really pleased by the heat of the thing, and were wondering if you could maybe switch the beer to water and a drop or two of spirits and dump some cocoa in there to basically turn it into cake.<br /><br /><br />Garlic Potato Packets: <small><a href="http://recipes.chef2chef.net/recipe-archive/33/177788.shtml" rel="nofollow">based upon this recipe</a></small><br />12      lg new potatoes; <br />half a block of butter<br />3       lg clove garlic<br />good whack of parsley and some coriander seed<br />juice   from half a lemon<br />just    enough tabasco<br />salt and pepper<br />6 sheets of foil; about 9 inches square<br /><br />Parboil the potatoes in salted water until they're just done- when you stick a knife in one there should be just a touch of resistance and the potato should stay intact. While they're on the go, mash all of the other ingredients (except the foil, no-one wants to chew that) in a bowl until you have a smooth garlic butter without any excess liquid. Give it a try and adjust to taste. When the potatoes are done, drained, and cool, cut them into easy to maneuver chunks (about a quarter of an inch across) and split them amongst the foil sheets equally, split the garlic butter amongst them with a good dollop on top of each, and then wrap them so that none of the goo can drip out when it melts (i.e. twisty end upward). When you have some neat little parcels, sling them on the coals and give them about 20-30 minutes or until the potatoes on the bottom have gone nice and crispy. <br /><br /><br />Grilled Fish <small><a href="http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=12382" rel="nofollow">based upon this recipe</a></small><br />3	Fish steaks (I used cod, but you could just as easily use tuna or swordfish)<br />juice   from half a lime<br />2	tbl Vegetable oil<br />2	tsp Fresh ginger root -- grated or finely chopped<br />1/4	tsp Cayenne pepper<br />3       spring onions<br />Black pepper to taste<br />Yet more foil<br /><br />With this one I decided to at least pay lip service to the oriental/fusion part of australian cooking. Whizz everything together but the fish. Cut the fish so that each steak has a pocket in it and, placing each steak on enough foil to wrap it in, distribute the resulting whizzed goo between the inside and the top of the fish. In an ideal world you'd marinate the damn things,  but if you can't be arsed or don't have the time you can just wrap the bundles up tight, throw them on the fire, and let them cook in the juices for about 20 minutes. The results are still lovely.<br /><br /><br />'Kill it and burn it' pig <small>based upon general reading and a vague understanding of barbecue sauce</small><br />pig. I found a joint on the cheap at the local supermarket. <br />knives. <br />goo. see below<br />foil if you like.<br />fire.<br /><br />And finally, the essence of Australian cooking. Taking a large part of an innocent animal, slicing it up (small boneless joint equals 6 steaks), adding some form of illconceived baste and setting fire to it. I did this both in parcels of foil, as above, and later without them. I actually found that without was more tasty, so long as you have some means of keeping your food above the coals rather than amongst them. For this one actually marinating the meat is highly advised, even if it's just for an hour.<br /><br />Notes: I didn't -actually- set fire to the pig, but with the amount of sugar in the goo I get the feeling that you probably could, and it would still be good eating.<br /><br /><br />'Kill it and burn it' goo<br />approximately:<br />3 tablespoons malt vinegar<br />1 heaped tablespoon dark (muscovado) sugar<br />1 1/2 tablespoons tomato puree<br />1 tablespoon sunflower oil<br />1 teaspoon whole grain mustard<br />1 teaspoon paprika<br />dash of worcestire sauce<br />some black pepper, salt and basil<br />some garlic (1 small clove) if you fancy it<br /><br />Which, suprisingly, winds up being just as good, if not better, than buy it in the shops barbecue sauce. I was certainly surprised seeing as the whole thing was, in the spirit of the outback, completely off the top of my head and using only what came to hand.<br /><br />Notes: I also get the feeling that the above proportions aren't entirely accurate, as it was all kind of done spur of the moment. Trust your taste buds and you'll be fine.<br /><br /><small>Generally: Please don't set fire to yourselves. Or your beer. Or eat moths. We engage in stupid acts of extreme cooking so that you don't have to. </small>
