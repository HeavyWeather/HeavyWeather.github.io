<p>Things that are happening at the moment that I am posting about because I cannot sleep:
</p>
<p>1.) I should stop being irresponsible around caffeine on school nights. That's definitely number one.
</p><p>2.) I do not exist. Clearly I do exist (I hope) but as far as my employers are concerned, I'm history. I totally forgot to hand my new work permit over to the university in the 10 day gap between returning to Canada and my contract renewal and was subsequently reminded through the somewhat heavy handed mechanism of not being paid. I'm living out of my savings at the moment and just hopinghopinghoping that they'll back date my pay the moment I break back into being. It isn't the first time this kind of thing has happened, but the first time it's happened here, so... *fingerscrossed*. If they don't backdate it, I'm totally taking an impromptu two week holiday. If I'm not being paid, I'm buggered if I'm going to work as hard.
</p><p>3.) I'm liking the little bits and pieces of the new Metric material that's around, and I'm pretty stoked about the upcoming April tour. Still pissed off about Amanda Palmer not coming to town though. Other good music at the moment is Little Boots, Akira The Don, Sage Francis again, and a return to Patrick Wolf. Wind In The Wires has been on repeat for about the last four days.
</p><p>4.) I've been a bit funny about my dreads over the last week or so. They've started to shrink like crazy (like, by half!) and some of them are superloopy due to previously weak mid-sections. I've spent a good chunk of today rolling the crap out of them and now they're pretty much okay. The only thing I'm not keen on is that I have a couple of fatties (already, and that I love, surprisingly) with really long wispy ends. I like loose ends but these are <i>mammoth</i>. I'm resolute in not doing anything crazy to them until the 7 month mark is up, and I'm constantly reminded that patience is key, but I really don't know how they're going to be by the 3 month milestone. That's kind of exciting, actually. I kind of wish I had <i>less</i> loose hair, and it's really tempting to combine a couple of the runty ones at the back and make up the numbers nearer the front. If I want more of them even when they're occasionally annoying I guess that must be a pretty good sign.
</p><p>5.) Mammoth is my new adjective of choice.
</p><p>6.) I'm teaching again, and it's awesome. We have a couple of students who are really very good and it gives me a big ol' happy. Bumping into one of the class at 3am on a friday when you're queuing for early morning poutine is less awesome, but I think I managed to avoid embarrassing myself too badly despite a large number of B52s bouncing around in my bloodstream. Standing next to a friend in a suit probably helped my respectability in some small way, although that would have been completely misleading considering who it was and what we were talking about.
</p><p>7.) Played a little wow today for the first time in about a friggin' month. It was a lot of fun. This combined with my sudden lack of income might well result in finally hitting 80 and getting my sexy shammy alt into an instance or twelve. Lolcatl is the best name evar and every time I see it I chuckle a little to myself.
</p><p>8.) My social life has picked up a lot since I got back though, so who knows. Even with a couple of lovely people leaving town who I'll miss terribly there's at least two things happening per week in addition to evening classes. I still need some folks more keen on dancing, but otherwise everything's goin' alright.
</p><p>9.) One of the things I've been doing is keeping on top of the McGill Music School schedule and attending anything that has the words 'cello' and 'free' in the description. Last week this resulted in one of the most comedy outings in a while as I unintentionally wound up sitting through an hour of really little kids trying their hardest on violins. It was an absolute joy, and made better by the last 30 minutes or so of 4 or 5 really very talented cellists in their late teens going for it in front of their families.
</p><p>10.) The rugby. Seriously. The rugby. *explodes*
</p><p>11.) My broccoli polenta cakes are even better with the addition of pesto in the mix and a balsamic vinegar dressing type thing underneath them. Looks well posh too. Better still is that I've finally pulled my finger out and learned how to make Saag Aloo, my favourite Indian dish of all time, and something I will now be eating every single week until I get sick of it. Hurrah!
</p><p>12.) I've been indulging in a shocking amount of photoshoppery recently and although I'll be the first to admit I'm not very good at it, it does seem that my level of skill scales in direct proportion to how evil I'm being. Shopping ponies out of inner city farms and into meadows? Jarring edges, terrible colour matching, and just, well, rubbish. Shopping Jesus' face onto the Ayatollah Khomeini? You'd almost believe the second coming had gone horribly horribly wrong. I'm kind of surprised that I managed to spell 'Ayatollah' correctly on the first attempt when it took me about four to get 'embarrassing' right. Ironically.
</p><p>13.) I'm doing quite badly at house hunting despite the fact that I'm getting more and more annoyed by my flat. I have, however, completely caved to the Montreal thing of being excessively excited about the upcoming summer. I still love the snow, and I'm becoming a bit of an iceninja in comparison to last year (when I nearly broke a hip), but damn do I want to do some basking in the sun.
