<p>A sneaking fog, warm and grey, has started to coil around Nimmel's feet. Out here on the Russian front such things are not uncommon, but sitting inside the burnt out building that he has been forced to call home, it raises a little more suspicion. Nimmel has seen many things these past few years that defy his expectation and he has learnt to pay attention to small things, out of place. In a way, that is his occupation. He muses on his life, on the fog, and continues with his paperwork.</p>

<p>He is mostly alone here, the others are out killing or dying in icy fields of ash. The quiet hiss behind him is entirely unexpected. He turns to look, but there is nothing. It is when he turns back to his letters that the construct makes itself seen, not three feet from the front of his desk. It unfolds from shadow, an immensely complex steel origami, and this close Nimmel can hear the whisper of gears meshing and unmeshing, the subtle pumping sounds of water and steam. It stands; almost silent, vaguely anthropomorphic, waiting. Sheathed in grey fog. </p>

<p>Nimmel is stunned, he has never seen anything like it before. Shaking and still seated, eyes wide, he draws his glock and levels it at the machine. It does not move. Instead there is the sound of metal in motion, and a katana blade settles itself on his shoulder from behind. Nimmel is petrified. The creature in front of him slides forward like silk and in its polished eyes Nimmel can see the reflection of its double behind him. The first machine steps smoothly up onto the desk, steel tendons and hydraulics visible beneath a blackened shell. It crouches to remove the gun from Nimmel's hand and crushes the primitive weapon neatly in one delicately engineered fist. The iron plates and joints dimly reminiscent of laminar armour, like samurai used to wear. The steam warrior clicks... and there is the sound of some subtle mechanism slipping into place- a noise that to Nimmel's ear heralds a hundred horrible deaths. Instead of murder it opens its mouth, and sings.</p>

<p>Fluting noises layer to form a surprisingly beautiful voice, entrancing Nimmel with its intricacy. He sits, still motionless, and listens to the plan of the divine wind rendered in brass and broken German, syllables controlled to near haiku. It is an atrocity of unparalleled magnitude. A flaming echo of American presumption. It is a plan, he is informed, that Nimmel will take from this barren wasteland to his superiors. It is expected that they will not believe him, but in the action of countless steadfast pilots Nimmel will be defined as an oracle of the East. An East that will collaborate with the Reich to dispose of the Russians, the Americans, the Chinese...</p>

<p>The song of plummeting death echoes around the room. It echoes in Nimmel's ears as the Nipponese engines slip away across Siberia. They leave him only with a fog of steam and their final verse:</p>

<p>Will's final limit.<br />
The end of all invention.<br />
Glory... </p>

<p>forever.</p>
