As a child I would let the sun go down and walk for hours into the country. I took comfort in lying down beneath the far off stars. In finding myself erased, by distance and heat, and power. Now I am older. I know the scale of things, and how to weigh them. I know the simple numbers of contraction and flame. I am erased again by elegance and grace. That there is a wave and a particle, that gives life, casts shadow, makes maps, that shows god moving over the face of the water. That there is a spin, of an azure body round a burning star, and a limit to how far even our gods could reach in the period of an orbit. <br /><br />The knowledge leaves me where there is no distance, no heat. No power to burn the fabric of all things to light. Where there is a scale of miniscule proportion. A weight that vanishes in definition beyond me. I exist within an ugly and furious confusion among the vanishing small. <br /><br />As I age though, I spend more time in the afternoon sun. I soak in heat as deserts might a titan's tear. I relax into my place. Slowly, the mass that is mine disappears completely. I accept it with peace, because even stars and gods have their limits... and I?<br /><br />Without weight, without distance, with only thought, I possess a grasp that far exceeds my reach.
