Really rather unusual, probably the most unusual food I've ever cooked. Primarily the recipes seem to be meat and root vegetables. The two most popular recipes I found were for <a href="http://www.dlc.fi/~marianna/gourmet/7_19.htm">Karelian Stew</a> and Janssons Frestelse. I was put off by the various recipes I read for Karelian Stew online - the shear quantity of meat especially the quantity of offal in quite a few of the versions.... urrgh! <br /><br />So, the meal I cooked was <a href="http://www.dlc.fi/~marianna/gourmet/5_6.htm">Janssons Frestelse</a> (Jansson's Temptation) an interesting potato and anchovy gratin. It really wasn't my first choice, but I was determined to cook something different and wouldn't consider cooking with offal. It was actually surprisingly nice - and this is coming from someone who doesn't like seafood. I served it with <a href="http://www.dlc.fi/~marianna/gourmet/1_5.htm">Karelian Potato pasties</a>. Unlike Cornish pasties these pasties are open, as it says in the recipe think of them as little pasty boats ^_^ Also <a href="http://www.kaiku.com/kutriskitchen.html">Lanttulaatikko</a> (Rutabaga Casserole). Rutabaga is a swede. This is a wonderful recipe, its so simple and tasty. With the addition of maybe a little mixed spice you have a very interesting and christmasy side dish.<br /><br />I haven't posted any recipes this time because I cooked everything without making any amendments.<br /><a name='cutid1-end'></a>
