Many towns have lost their lighthouses over the years to neglect, but the harbour here was built narrow, with high cliffs close by. The winters of '64 and '23 both saw local sailors scrambling into a ragged flotilla to rescue ships from hidden rocks, before cold water could claim their crew. Those same rocks have been mapped well since, but the risks have not been entirely removed. Fishing boats still need help to cross the water.

Two hundred years, more or less, have seen a beam search from north to south, and all that time has been kept by old men with minds as focused as the lamp itself: Harrington, Merryweather, Granton and Stack, Thomas, Revelwood, Jennings and Down. Now Berwick, who often reads the diaries of those who came before. His life is surrounded by theirs, every one of them having outlived their families and deeded their paltry wealth to a mutual home. It has become tradition, and Berwick writes diaries purely because to do otherwise would be a failure. He will not be the forgotten keeper or the blank book. The logs will be filled, and each one will be accompanied by his own looping scratch. Some of his predecessors drew birds, some clouds. They have written both fictions and facts, and in places the two have intertwined. Keeping a lighthouse is lonely work, and not all of the keepers have taken well to the quiet, even if the log is nigh-perfect in its completeness. There are only eight gaps. Each one is a death.

Berwick has no plans to die soon. The steps keep him fit, he has all of his own teeth, and his blue eyes are bright. Some of the previous tenants have gone strange for a lack of visitors, but his niece is fast approaching fifteen, and has become inquisitive as a result of a shore to walk, and introspective from high windows overlooking the sea. Her hair is sandy blonde and her eyes a greenish blue, as if regular visits have left their mark on her body as well as her mind. She has taken to the diaries with a passion far exceeding Berwickâ€™s own. Where his entries are dutiful, hers are florid. Dhalia often sits on the balcony outside the lamp room, listens to the waves, and writes. Just as often, and more when it is cold, she sits inside by the fire and listens to her uncle read the entries of keepers long past: Facts, fictions, and the uncertain territory between the two.
