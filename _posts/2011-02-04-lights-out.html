<p><span>My earliest memory is of light like white gold. I am maybe four, maybe five, and I am walking down the stairs in my house. They are unfinished wood, and they glow a pale but warm yellow in the morning sun. Small flecks of wood dust dance in the light. I can smell cooking bacon and timber, and I know that my mother is by the stove. Everything I can smell and see and hear feels like love. Before this, it is all just snapshots, just fleeting moments. If my life were to flash before my eyes, this would be the earliest, brightest, flare.</span><span> </span></p>

<p><span>In the three years after that memory, I had recurring nightmares. Those golden stairs were part of an extension that my father built, and eventually I moved to the back of the house. I woke up every night until then sweating, or screaming. My first bedroom looked down upon a graveyard, the church attached to it all wooden slats and claustrophobic angles. The whole place was dead, but maybe I saw a thing in the cramped yard that I recognised. Each night a titanic shadow would ghost to the foot of my bed, and watch my terror until I woke up. It never did anything but stand there, its nebulous weight crushing everything in its aura.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span><br/></span><span>Later, much later, I left London one winter to visit my mother. All the power went out while I was there, and I took the time to see that small town without lights. It was like suddenly being hundreds of years in the past. Clouds came in to take away what little light was left, and you couldn’t tell that the world had ever built clocks or computers. Nothing but fields stretched out to the horizon. There were no ghosts in that darkness, but there was no future either. Some small error had just switched off all of the history I knew. It was 1999, I think. The faint yellow glow of candles became visible, but they only gave strength to a sense of lost time, of centuries that might have never happened at all.</span><span> </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>When the power came back on, it was like an invisible hand sweeping over everything, bringing it all into the present as it went. I thought the lights would all come back at once, but they didn&rsquo;t. It was like a wave. For a moment you could see two worlds. One with computers, and cities of millions of people, and a future. The other one only had candles, and its buildings were largely empty. I was still for a minute. I was unsure what I had just seen. When I eventually got home there was a film on about the end of the world. We had missed about half of it while the power was out, but it was okay. The world was the way it had always been, and nothing had followed me back out of the dark.</span></p>
