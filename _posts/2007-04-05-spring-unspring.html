<p>I&#8217;ve moved house, I&#8217;ve finally unpacked my bags into a wardrobe or two (more or less) and spring has sprung. The temperature falters, and then soars somewhere around a wonderous 10c. It&#8217;s been warm enough for it to finally rain. Not big fat clots of damp snow, but actual rain. The grass is peaking out from under frost, and the smell is just, indescribable. My boots are slung to the back of the cupboard, my winter coat has been retired.</p>
<p>Except this is Montreal. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been warned, I know. </p>
<p>Looking outside right now, the snow is vertical. Straight up. Some curl of downtown current has pushed the <i>freezing</i> wind between my building and the next and back up into the sky. It&#8217;s thick enough on the ground that the grass is gone. It&#8217;s thick enough in the air that outside, my bare, unscarved, face is far from happy. Even toward the end, winter&#8217;s grip is tight and harsh here. Slowly, I&#8217;m coming to realise why there&#8217;s such a local enthusiasm for the coming summer. And I&#8217;m starting to feel it myself. </p>
<p>Back in London it&#8217;s nearly 20c, and the sun is shining.<br />
Here it&#8217;s -4, and the lizard part of my brain is desperately longing for St. James&#8217; Park, a deck chair, and an end to snow.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s magical and all, but <b>enough</b> already.</p>
