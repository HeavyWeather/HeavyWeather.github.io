<b>Unpopular Dream</b><br /><br />Even in today's world I find him intimidating. Elongated, blue-skinned, orange-haired. He catches me looking down at where he sits and grins three smiles back at me. Waves an eight fingered hand, the other typing at warp speed. When we found out we could be anything we wanted, this is what he saw in his mind's eye, multifaceted. I'm intimidated, because I just wanted to look like Christinna Ricci circa 'The Adam's Family'. And now I do. <br /><br />Sometimes he takes me to see his friends, and it's like looking through a kaleidoscope. Some aren't even recognizably people. They're flying ribbons of acrobatic, sensual, bliss, or enormous furred titans the color of honey. They open their mouths, if they have them, and what spills out is pure fantasy. Then they go away, and the next time we see them, they're holding wonders. I have no idea where they go, but I've never seen one of them in real life. I get the feeling that if i didn't live with him, I'd never know. I'd never see these creatures living their unpopular dream. The rest of the world just potters along, changing their flesh with the season to fit the fashion. And his friends look up at us from where they sit, grinning, and full of honest pity. Changing only to refine.<br /><br />It bugs me sometimes, that I can't really tell anyone about them. That most people will never get to know that they even exist. It's such a waste, that they have to remain hidden like precious night-blooming flowers. Maybe the world will change again someday soon, but so that they fit, turned around pieces of jig-saw. I'd like to look up from my seat at the coffee shop and see something wonderful across from me. Reading the New York Times. Doing the crossword four clues as one.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
