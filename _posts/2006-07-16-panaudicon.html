The flowers sing at Werryn as she reels, all high pitched and fluttering disharmony. It makes her ill, disturbs her balance, and it is all her fault. Left alone to talk to the world her charm has reached too far. Quera is nowhere to be seen as Werryn stumbles, through the brook and up the bank. Birds screech on her passing, trees sighing their disapproval with bowel trembling bass. Werryn will one day make a sorceress of epics, if she can only get to Quera and beg her to make the grass stop screaming. <br /><br />It is the alien dissonance that nearly kills her, and even years hence she will panic in an apparently quiet moment. Straining to hear if the aching chorus is there, clapping her hands to her head and shaking in fear. She falls at the feet of her mistress with that same motion, wailing against the wind's abrasive gossip and the thousands upon thousands of cries that rise from beneath her. Quera tries to calm her, but every word is lost to the choir. Out of sheer desperation Quera spits upon her right hand in ritual, drags the bloody lids of her empty left eye apart, and lays a deafening hex upon Werryn.<br /><br />It is enough to buy relief, enough for the girl to rein back her own lay. She grips hard to her mistress, and brings on an element of calm, though through it all is a single mammoth note that fills her chest fit to burst. Just when she is ready to drown on it the charm is done, and she knows the sound for what it is. It is the turn of the earth beneath her feet. It is the reach of her grasp.
