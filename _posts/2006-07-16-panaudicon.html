The flowers sing at Werryn as he reels, all high pitched and fluttering disharmony. It makes him ill, disturbs his balance, and it is all his fault. Left alone to talk to the world his charm has reached too far. Quera is nowhere to be seen as Werryn stumbles, through the brook and up the bank. Birds screech on his passing, trees sighing their disapproval with bowel trembling bass. Werryn will one day make a sorcerer of great legend, if he can only get to Quera and beg her to make the grass stop screaming. <br /><!--more--><br />It is the alien dissonance that nearly kills him, and even years after he will panic in an apparently quiet moment. Straining to hear if the aching chorus is there, clapping his hands to his head and shaking in fear. He falls at the feet of her mistress with that same motion, wailing against the wind's abrasive gossip and the thousands upon thousands of cries that rise from beneath him. Quera tries to calm him, but every word is lost to the choir. Out of sheer desperation Quera spits upon her right hand in ritual, drags the bloody lids of her empty left eye apart, and lays a deafening hex upon Werryn.<br /><br />It is enough to buy relief, enough for the boy to rein back his own lay. He grips hard to his mistress, and brings on an element of calm, though through it all is a single mammoth note that fills his chest fit to burst. Just when he is ready to drown on it the charm is done, and he knows the sound for what it is. It is the turn of the earth beneath his feet. It is the reach of his grasp.
