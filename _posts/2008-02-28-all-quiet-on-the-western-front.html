<p>Which is how most of February has been. For the larger part of the month I've been chewing my fingernails about my immigration status, and whether or not I'll be allowed to stay in Canoobia. As it turns out, things are all good. Or at least, I'm told things are all good. I have yet to receive documentation that assures me that this is the case. For those of you thinking about immigrating anywhere- always ensure that your papers are in with plenty of time to spare! There's the vague possibility that I've had a week or two of illegal immigrant status which I'm sure will be marvellously entertaining if I -don't- get deported. </p>
<p>Due to this slight worry I've been confined to the country for the last two months, as there's been the vague possibility that once out, I won't be able to get back in as a working resident. This is a shoddy development anyway as it distinctly limits my wanderlust, but it also means no snowboarding, as the club has been going to Vermont a lot lately. Unfortunate as I've managed to get my downhill time from 45 minutes to 7, although only on one side of the board. I'm looking forward to trying the same thing on both sides as an ambi-turner while not scraping my face across 875m of mountain when they eventually return to the Laurentians or my passport is bang up to date. My first full mountain experience was certainly interesting. An unsuspecting gentleman hauled me up to the top where I promptly freaked out for five minutes (turns out I -am- still slightly scared of heights), before realising that there was no way down except strapped to a plank. Once I got down though I wasn't to be stopped. Mostly because I couldn't figure out the learner's slope ski-lift and had no choice but to go back to the top!</p>
<p>Since being kept from the slopes I'm sad to say that I've spent probably far too much time on WoW, due to the fact that it's bloody cold out. This rationale makes little sense when given the chance I'd hurl myself down a frozen hill at quite a few miles an hour. While I'm being terribly sad though- 1.) Karazhan is very silly 2.) I have realised that I'm never going to do -very- well at the game because I have things like a job, and a flat with my girlfriend. This isn't a jibe, but they are things to be thankful for 3.) Finally a Nobilis game! 4.) To all of those I've been abusing due to the rugby, don't be too worried. It's not like you're the only ones to get a kicking from Wales this year.</p>
<p>The only real instance of out and out awesome this month (apart from the rugby) has therefore been walking on water like Jesus. Except, you know, a frozen river. Not much like Jesus. I have been reading an awful lot of mythology though, so who knows what might happen come spring? Probably me actually writing something again. Buses are good for that, and I'm starting up the French classes again in earnest next week. I've also been eating far too much fresh mozzarella, which has provided me with plenty of original (read 'bloody weird') material. Otherwise it's been a very comfortable month, which is good to have once in a while, but does get me itching to be out and about.</p>
<p>The new music list is heaving most likely because of this little pause. Meanwhile... Back in Communist Russia, God Is An Astronaut, MGMT, Mono, Holy Fuck, The Miserable Rich, The Swell Season, the new Teagan and Sara album (which I like despite myself), Reverend and The Makers, Robyn (still, shhh!), and the astoundingly named ""Upcdowncleftcrightcabc+start". I've also been listening to a lot of the mighty GLC, because very little else makes me smile quite so fast. </p>
<p>If you see me on a bus, tapping my foot, come ask me what it is. It'll be good, I assure you.</p>
