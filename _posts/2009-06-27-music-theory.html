There are some musical acts who are, I feel, cultural scenery. When they go, no matter how big they are, their disappearance is no more important to me than a particularly large building that took up a lot of skyline, but that I spent very little time inside. Nothing looks the same afterwards, but I don't really care all that much. The amount of investment a particular person has in a band is obviously a very personal feeling. I think it's interesting that there are some artists you lose the same way you would a friend, though, and more so that those bands are different for different people. Peter Murphy, Clint Mansell, Jim Morrison (Jim Bob from Carter, not the already very dead Doors front-man), Justin Sullivan, Jello Biafra, Robert Smith, Nick Cave, even Keith Flint, these are the street corners, the parking lots, the pubs and parks where I've spent huge swathes of my life. If I were to turn around and find that any of them had disappeared, vanished without meaning or purpose, I would be more than a little lost. Those landmarks have helped me orient my life to some degree. Even where they are broken down, disused, and faded from their former glories, I still value their presence. I can sit down after a long day on the curb between Sullivan and Murphy and relax, no matter how broken down the neighbourhood is. That place is, in a very real sense, my home.<br /><br />So no, I'm not bereft now that Michael Jackson is dead. Despite the best efforts of the American Newsmedia. I never lived there, and I don't know the district.<br /><br />But the world is different without him, and I do know how it must feel if he was a landmark inside your heart.
