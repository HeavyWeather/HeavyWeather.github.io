<p><b>Nerd warning: may contains traces of geography, MMORPG, and obscure fantasy fiction.</b>

<p>A quick trip to blizzard to sort out a few bits and pieces has led me to a (possibly) interesting chain of thought. Warcraft currently boasts 'over 11 million users'. In terms of real world localities, that's at least comparable to the 5th largest city on Earth (SÃ£o Paulo), and depending on the exact numbers, might match Delhi (4th), or even Istandbul (3rd). I'm somewhat stunned by this number, but more stunned by the implication- Imagine if that analogy were realised. As amusing as it would undoubtedly be, I'm not talking about ghetto-ising all the players of WOW into one real world settlement. I'm suggesting an online city.
</p>
<p>Warcraft leverages the fantasy construct of the 'unconquered wild', a place where savage beasts roam free, ancient evils lurk, and powerful artefacts are strewn about like confetti at a wedding. Leaf through the sci-fi/fantasy section of your nearest bookshop though, and you'll see that the 'city of mystery' trope is just as strong. Dalaran and Shattrath are practically backwater hamlets by comparison to Lankhmar, Ankh-Morpork, Sigil, New Crobuzon, The Sprawl, Sharn, Gotham, Camorr, Middenheim, Dhalgren*, Viriconium*, the list goes on. With 11 million users; game engines that have been refined through Neverwinter Nights, Oblivion(/Fallout3), Thief(/Splintercell/Assassin's Creed), Fable, and a whole host of modern day urban environment games; <i>and</i> declining prices in bandwidth, memory, and server space, highly populated fictional cities are slowly becoming reasonable prospects.
</p>
<p>There would undoubtedly be huge problems to overcome (imagine the lag! Theeeee LAAAAAAAAGGGG!), but to someone who dabbles in tabletop rpg, genre fiction, and muhmorrrpurrgerers, the potential richness of that fantasy city is a bit of a spaffathon. I'm referring to wealth in terms of depth of experience, but I have to admit that there's something in the lizard part of my brain that's watching pound signs spiral upward (matrix-style) to spread out a skyline, slowly form towering spires, and dedicate each one to an invisible god of trade.

<p>*Okay, maybe not Dhalgren. Definitely not Viriconium. Viriconium would be the MMORPG equivalent of a highly aggressive memetic virus. OH HAI! I'Z IN UR CITIES BECOMIN UR DREAMZ. VIRICONIUM CAT IZ NOT VIRICONIUM CAT IZ NOT SUSPENDIN' UR DISBELIEFZ. Dhalgren cat would just be in the back of shot somewhere, cloaked in amnesia, a concealing fog, and a jittery holographic projection of a unicorn.</p>
