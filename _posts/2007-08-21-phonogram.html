<p>If you were anywhere between your early teens and, well... dead, during the mid 90s, you own a copy of, say, 'different class', and you like comic books (a relatively small demographic) go pick up <a href="http://www.phonogramcomic.com/blog/?page_id=3">Phonogram</a> by Keiron Gillen immediately. Its entire first run of six issues is complete, so you have no excuse for not buying it all, sitting yourself down, putting on Elastica, and reading the lot in one go.</p>

<p>It will make you realise what you had, and remember it in a better light than it ever recieved in the dinge of cigarette smoke and disco light. I could describe it as a retrospective celebration of the wonder attached to British indie at its peak, but I wouldn't be saying enough. </p>
<p>Shortly after reading it, I noticed how The Cure's 'Faith' sounds almost exactly like an obituary for Joy Division's 'She's lost Control'. As if Robert Smith was stood, invisible, beside Ian Curtis all the while. </p>
<p>Telling you that is probably the best I can do.</p>
