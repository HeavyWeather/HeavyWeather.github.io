I lost all my teeth last night, but it's okay, they're back now. They taste funny, and when I spit it's dark. But I'm getting used to it. Sudden cavities and sudden fillings come and go overnight.

<!--more-->When I was five I kept all my old teeth in a jar with a screw top lid. Dead wasps, bent pennies, bits of dirt, and all my old teeth: Aging in the sun. One day I heard about the tooth fairy from another kid, and that night I left a scrawled 'fuck you' under my pillow in big, red, greasy, crayon.

We spend the rest of our lives paying for the stupid shit we do as children.
