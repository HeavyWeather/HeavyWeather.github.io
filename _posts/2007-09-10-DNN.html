<p>In the Dee related news today:</p>
<p>o Bloc Party are astounding live, to the point where I found it a bit difficult to breathe for a minute or two. Putting out a dedication to Brits washed up in Montreal and then playing my two favouritest songs back to back (including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8oRFcA0mFM">The Prayer</a>, obviously) mid-way through a set of tunes largely about living in London made my night. The Northern Line -is- the loudest, particularly on the way to Stockwell. Uniform was also a highlight, as Mr. Okereke sings and plays with such visible disappointment and disgust. It's an odd place to be in, when you know a place so well, that even its failures are things that you miss.</p>
<br class="clear" /><lj-cut text="read more"><p>o Although... when you're aching for home, even the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohLd4C-Bh0Y">Arctic Monkeys</a> (who are all about 15) can get you singing along. They do, after all, say that Sheffield changes when the sun goes down. I like to fool myself that I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor is an ode to Lauren Laverne. Maybe I just have a soft spot for the Sheffield accent. And Lauren Laverne.</p>
<p>o I am aware of all this because I wound up at <a href="http://www.osheaga.com/">Osheaga</a> yesterday. Expensive, dirty, but worth it just for Bloc Party really. Other bands of note did include Au Revoir Simone, We Are Scientists (surprisingly), The Besnard Lakes, and You say party! We say die! Note to self, find their track Giant Hands- it's a stonker.</p>
<p>o Being skinny, under the age of 30, and enjoying indie, does not make me a skinny indie kid, just so you know. Along with London, I'm also pining for my big comfy Bauhaus t-shirt that I have lost. And revelling in my big comfy goth jumper, which I have found. Unfortunately the latter does not quite make up for the former as I suspect that my t-shirt is irreplacable, as opposed to something that I could probably work into shape over the course of a few winters. I am desolate, inconsolable, and you know, shining like thunder, crying like rain.</p>
<p>o On the subject of imbalance, I have just had a very large mocha frappacino to make up for last night's lack of sleep. This was probably not clever in any way.</p>
<p>o Have also started another short fiction project thing (Mr. Xero, take note), as Hidden Tracks is long done, and the other two are kind of ungoing unreliables. Short summary and link to the relevant archives is at the bottom of <a href="http://www.icememory.net/cms/node/90">this page</a>. In a way, this is a warning that dubious fiction may be showing up in your friendslist more frequently, although I do cut pretty much everything by default.</p>
<p>o On which note, time to get moving, as the implacable french classes continue apace. I may or may not make it through this week awake, or alive, but if I do, who knows what new adventures may occur?</p>
