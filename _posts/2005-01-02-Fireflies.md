She smiles at me as the thrushes fall like snow behind her, feather and bone layer across the rooftops and the pavement. Electric beauty arcs from her flesh. My breath swirls around hers.

We came up here to watch the stars. She smiled, tilted her head at me and closed her eyes. Lashes touching, a feather of shadow, her breath sighs.

'The stars aren't bright enough...'

I can feel my heart skip a beat as her chest rises. Arrhytmia stutters my eyesight as it falls. Spring gathers round, but my fingertips are numb, lost to winter. I can barely hear her: she slips closer while the landscape distorts and slides away.

'...let me see you.'

Her voice echoes on the wind. Her eyelids are perfectly white. Not a single blemish... they're relaxed...
they're closed.

'You're so bright...'

She shivers as cats cries are stopped mid-song. As gravity peels my flesh away. I can hear her perfectly. Hear my skin slap against concrete. I'm sat in front of her, but her breath swirls free.

'...brighter than the stars.'
