It's a fable, an urban legend. A tome bound in the tongues of a hundred and one investment bankers. It is said, it is whispered (near water-coolers and outside boardrooms), that those who read it learn the secret languages of the world. Or go insane: Gibbering victims of the Tee-em-eye. On trading floors, in chambers of law, across the ephemeral reaches of the information economy, its disciples lurk like phantoms. Cloaking meaning behind nonsensical syllables that resonate with perfect brevity. Communing only in code that baffles the innocent mind. Year after year the souls of young men and women vanish. Sacrificed to its power they become drones that unwittingly repeat each holy phrase and suffer accordingly: Victims of the Acronomicon.
