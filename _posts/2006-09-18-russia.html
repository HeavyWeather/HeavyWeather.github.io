Sorry bout the delay in postalising this.<br />So, a few weeks ago I had the task of cooking from everyone's favourite former soviet republic, Russia.<br /><br />Russians are random, they eat some strange stuff. Involving far more noodles than you would expect (which as you will see I featured none of)<br /><br />For the main course I decided on homemade Kiev style baked chicken breasts accompanied by a random russian recipe potato salad. <br /><br />- Baked Chicken Breasts recipe -<br /><br />100 g butter <br />1/2 tsp finely shredded lemon peel<br />1 tbsp lemon juice<br />freshly ground black pepper<br />6 whole large chicken breasts skinned, and boned<br />1 egg<br />1 tbsp water<br />1 cup flour<br />2/3 cup breadcrumbs<br /><br />-Method-<br />In mixing bowl cream the butter till light and fluffy. Add lemon peel, lemon juice, and pepper. Mix thoroughly. Reserve 1/ 4 cup of the mixture. Shape the remaining mixture into 6 sticks; freeze till firm. Place 1 chicken breast at a time and pound to flatten. Sprinkle lightly with a little salt. <br />Place 1 stick of the butter mixture on each breast. Roll up. Seal carefully with wooden picks. Beat egg and water together. Coat chicken lightly with flour; dip in egg mixture, then coat with breadcrumbs.<br />Heat the reserved butter mixture in skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook on all sides 10 to 15 minutes, turning gently.<br />Place chicken in a baking dish and bake in 400 degree oven for 15 to 17 minutes. Remove wooden picks. If desired, trim with parsley.<br /><br />-Salad Olivier-<br /><br />1 whole chicken breast, poached, boned, and skinned, or 1/2 pound lean cooked veal.<br />1 pound all-purpose potatoes, boiled in their skins and peeled.<br />2 medium Cucumbers in Brine.<br />1 cup cooked fresh or frozen peas.<br />1 medium onion, finely chopped.<br />1 cup Mayonnaise.<br />2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and quartered.<br />8 large black Greek olives.<br />8 sprigs parsley<br /><br />-Method-<br />Cut the cooked chicken and potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes. Peel the cucumbers and also cut into 1/2-inch cubes. In a large bowl, combine the meat, potatoes, cucumbers, green peas, and onion. Add the mayonnaise and mix gently, so those ingredients are not mashed.<br /><br />Refrigerate the salad until serving time (but for no longer than 4 hours).<br /><br />For Desert we had the randomness that are Sirniki. Cheese based pancakes served with sour cream and Jam. Nummy. <br /><br />-Sirniki-<br />500 grams Curd (Substitute Cottage Cheese)<br />2 Eggs<br />6 tablespoons Flour (you may need to add a little more)<br />2 tablespoons Sugar<br />1 teaspoon Salt<br /><br />-Method-<br />Blend curd, eggs, flour, sugar & salt. (use a whisk or blender for this)<br />Take piece of paste, make round, flat shape & put on warm frying pan with oil. (you will probably just have to ladle into a hot frying pan)<br />Wait until it becomes gold colour and flip.<br />When it brown on both sides you can eat it. (cover in sour cream and jam)<br /><br />and your done.<br /><br /><a href='http://ruscuisine.com/cooking-recipes/index.php/Meat-Dishes/?recipe=539&offset=0' rel='nofollow'>http://ruscuisine.com/cooking-recipes/index.php/Meat-Dishes/?recipe=539&offset=0</a><br /><a href='http://www.russianfoods.com/recipes/item00003/default.asp' rel='nofollow'>http://www.russianfoods.com/recipes/item00003/default.asp</a><br /><a href='http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Sirniki' rel='nofollow'>http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Sirniki</a>
