Too quiet. I've looked up the date to see if it's a Canadian holiday I don't know about, I've listened really hard at my door, I've even looked out the window to scan the streets for signs of the coming apocalypse. Only moving cars assure me that anyone is still alive at all.
<p>I'm not sure, but I think almost everyone is on <i>vacation</i>.</p>
