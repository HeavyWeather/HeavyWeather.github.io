I'd spotted them in the list and researched them in advance because I prefer the challenge of finding recipes from less well known places. When I say less well known, maybe that should only apply to me as my mum knew exactly where these islands are.<br /><br />Turks and Caicos islands have more than a passing mention in history. They were 'discovered' in 1492 by Christopher Columbus, John Glenn touched down just off the coast in 1962 and a proposed union is Canada is on the cards.<br /><br />The best bit is that I got to cook something I've wanted to try for ages - Saltfish and Ackee! I came across a mention of ackee as a child, I can't remember where probably a natural history program, and it stuck in my mind because it can be poisonous ^_^<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akee.jpg"><center><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Akee.jpg/240px-Akee.jpg" width="240" height="180"></center></a><br /><br />Only the flesh of ackee is safe to eat, and then only when it has naturally opened, otherwise you can suffer from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_vomiting_sickness">Jamaican vomiting sickness</a>.<br /><br />Saltfish and Ackee <small><a href="http://www.turksandcaicos.gour.net/Recipes.294.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_nicosdirectory_pi1[mode]=detail&amp;tx_nicosdirectory_pi1[modifier]=abc&amp;tx_nicosdirectory_pi1[value]=64&amp;cHash=9b9ae5e750">based on this recipe</a></small><br />4 portions of cod<br />1 tin of ackee (the tins stocked here are oversized, 1 1/2 times the size of standard tins)<br />1 onion, thinly sliced<br />1 red pepper, thinly sliced<br />1/2 scotch bonnet chili<br />1 tsp black pepper<br />Oil<br /><br />Fry the onion and pepper until soft, set aside half. Add the cod, ackee pepper and chili. Cook for 15 / 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Serve and garnish with the onion and pepper set aside earlier.<br /><br /><br />Rice and Peas <small><a href="http://www.milk.tciway.tc/cooking/peasandrice.htm">Based on this recipe</a><br />1 onion, sliced<br />1 red pepper, sliced<br />6 rashers of bacon, sliced<br />2 tbs tomato paste<br />2 tbs olive oil<br />1 can pigeon peas (sometimes called Gungo pea)<br />50g brown rice<br />150 / 200ml water<br />1 vegetable stock cube<br />salt<br />fresh thyme<br />bay leaf<br />black pepper<br />oil<br /><br />Fry the onion, pepper and bacon until the onion goes soft / bacon cooked. Add the tomato paste, peas, salt, thyme, bay leaf, black pepper, water, stock cube and rice. Simmer until the rice is cooked.<br /><br />Both these recipes are simple, really quick and so tasty! Whilst the ackee / gungo peas are speciality ingredients around here, I expect black-eyed or pinto beans could be substituted in the rice and peas. That recipe is going straight into my stock when I have surprise guests.<br /><br /><br />Another two recipes you might want to check out are:<br /><a href="http://www.milk.tciway.tc/cooking/rumcake.htm">Pirates Rum Cake</a><br /><a href="http://www.turksandcaicos.gour.net/Recipes.294.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_nicosdirectory_pi1[mode]=detail&amp;tx_nicosdirectory_pi1[modifier]=abc&amp;tx_nicosdirectory_pi1[value]=63&amp;cHash=18c732ff94">Spicy Carrot Bread</a><a name='cutid1-end'></a></small>
