She clings to the side of the stairway and shifts her grip into a better position for her feet. A handful of steps are gone, leaving only an echoing void and the skeletal railing behind. It is terribly old, the metal aged a pale medical green. The rail leans inwards, only safe from the outside, and shrieks quietly when her weight tentatively explores each angle. She takes a deep breath, holds it for a second, and exhales rapidly: foot to hand, hand to weight, both feet and a frantic reach, then over in a falling tangle. It is all so sudden, and done. The stairs curve away beneath her. There are scratches across her stomach, hitches in her breathing. She blinks hard, and again, resting her back into the wall. Except that there is no gap. The stairs are whole. The railing roars in coppery glory. She reaches out a trembling hand, and the nearest edge is cool beneath her grip. She realises that her whole body is shaking, but this time, knows that she's awake.

Either something is horribly wrong, or a thing that has been steadily changing since she came back to Sleepness has quietly slipped into a new and stable position. She turns her head to peer down into the dark, hands slid beneath her, fingers locked into the masonry. The Mysterium waits below. Only now, she can feel the gravity of it.

Clambering to her feet, the rest of the stairway passes in a fugue. Small cherubic statues slip from corroded and buckled to gleaming and upright as she slowly steps past each one. Mosses vanish, the silvery trails of slugs and snails erase themselves. Ivy unwinds around the metalwork it has eaten. By the time she has reached the final flight there is a shining spiral of copper, and bronze, and freshly finished stone winding up to the surface world above her. The tension in the curl of it is immense, as if the changes her footsteps have wrought would snap and spit backwards at the slightest provocation. There is a hurricane in here, caught in granite and filigree and the ghost of a dream.

At the bottom there is an arch. The carvings around its span are too worn to make out. She feels as if she knew what they were, once, that she's seen them before, while asleep. They will be impossible to read after she's passed beneath them. Maybe they will be illegible when she returns. Except that the rules have changed now. Maybe there is no coming back. The dim light is all shades of green and blue and gold, and it comes from nowhere. The pressure she feels is benthic. The arch, still in front of her, dark, unblinking, is the eye of a leviathan. She steps forward, almost stumbles, steps again. Pushing her body across the threshold, she remembers, finally, every detail of the carving above her.

It is too late.
